\noindent{{\bf 10.9  Exercises}}

\item {1.} 	From Section 10.2  Consider two electrons in $\delta$ 
orbitals.  Find the wavefunctions and
symmetries of the final states, as in (17), and predict the energy
ordering, as in Figure 3.

\item {2.}	How would the results in this section change if one electron were in
a $\pi_u$ orbital, $\pi_{ux}$ or $\pi_{uy}$, and one in a $\pi_g$ 
orbital, $\pi_{gx}$ or $\pi_{gy}$.  Indicate the symmetries and 
wavefunctions, as in (17), and the energy ordering, as in Figure 3.
