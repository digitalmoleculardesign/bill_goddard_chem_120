\chapter{Atoms}\label{chap05}\section{Introduction}In this chapter, we will examine the wavefunctions for the ground states of atoms.  A key idea is the Aufbau principle, which forms the basis for understanding chemical regularities of atoms.Throughout this chapter, we will use atomic units of $\hbar = 1$, $| e | = 1$, and $m_e = 1$.  Consequently, the unit of energy is $h_0 = 1$ hartree = 27.2116 $eV =$ 627.51 kcal/mole, and the unit of length is $a_0 = 1$  bohr = 0.52918\AA.  First, we will examine the excited states of the H atom.\section{Excited States H Atoms}Rather than derive the eigenstates of the hydrogen atom, by standard techniquesof partial differential equations, we prefer to examine the qualitative reasons behind the forms of the solutions.  Although the Schr\"odinger equation\begin{equation}H \phi = E \phi\end{equation}can be solved for the H atom, it cannot for most other systems of interest, and hence, qualitative reasoning will be almost essential in most systems.In atomc units\begin{equation}H = - {1 \over 2} \nabla^2 - {Z \over r} .\label{chap5-eqno1}\end{equation}Because $H$ is independent of orientation, the exact eigenstates can be factored into a radial part $R(r)$, and an angular part $Z( \theta , \varphi)$\begin{equation}\phi ( r , \theta , \varphi ) = R ( r ) Z ( \theta , \varphi )\end{equation}where $z = r \cos \theta$, $x = r \sin \theta \cos \varphi$, and $y = r \sin \theta \sin \varphi$.\subsection{Angular Functions}From $H \phi = E \phi$, we obtain\begin{equation}E = \langle \phi | H | \phi \rangle = T + V,\end{equation}where, using atomic units, from (\ref{chap5-eqno1})\begin{equation}V = \langle \phi | - {Z \over r} | \phi \rangle\end{equation}and\begin{equation}T = - {1 \over 2} \langle | \nabla^2 | \phi \rangle = {1 \over 2} \langle | \nabla \phi |^2 \rangle.\label{chap5-eqno2}\end{equation}Using spherical coordinates, $r, \theta , \varphi$, we will first fix the radial coordinate $r$ and examine functions of angular coordinates $\theta$, $\varphi$ only.At fixed $r$, the potential energy $V$ is independent of angular coordinate and hence, it is the kinetic energy that is affected by the angular part of the wavefunction.  Since the kinetic energy is proportional to the average square of the gradient of the wavefunction, the best, lease energy, angular function is the smoothest, i.e., a constant\begin{equation}\phi_0 ( \theta , \varphi ) = 1.\label{chap5-eqno3}\end{equation} It is convenient to define an integer $l$ indicating the number ofangular nodal planes.  Later, $l$ will be referred to as the totalorbital angular momentum quantum number.  The function(\ref{chap5-eqno3}) has the same sign for all $\theta$ and $\varphi$,and hence, is $l = 0$.All other angular functions must be orthogonal to (\ref{chap5-eqno3}),and hence, all must have an equal number of positive and negativeregions, $l \geq 1$.  As the number of angular nodal planes, $l$increases, the average square of the gradient increases, and hence,the angular kinetic energy increases.  Thus, the angular functionswill be ordered as $l = 0, l = 1, l = 2$, and $l = 3$, etc.There are three orthogonal functions, all having one nodal plane.  For example,\begin{eqnarray}\phi_z ( \theta , \varphi ) &=& {z \over r} = \cos \theta\cr\phi_x ( \theta , \varphi ) &=& {x \over r} = \sin \theta \cos \varphi\cr\phi_y ( \theta , \varphi ) &=& {y \over r} = \sin \theta \cos \varphi\label{chap5-eqno4}\end{eqnarray}Any other function, with one nodal plane, and orthogonal to $l = 0$,can be written as a linear combination of the functions in(\ref{chap5-eqno4}).  It is easy to see that these functions areorthogonal. For example,\begin{equation}\phi_z \phi_x = \left( {zx \over r^2} \right)\end{equation}leads to two nodal planes and phases as shown following% YT?%\centerline{{{\ithick=.8pt \othick=0pt \spacing=12pt \abovehr=18pt %\belowhr=20pt \nexttovr=30pt%\table{z}-!+\rr +!-\caption{} }}}\noindentand hence, the angular integral,\begin{equation}\langle \phi_z | \phi_x \rangle = \int d \Omega \phi_z \phi_x ,\end{equation}must yield zero. Since there are three $l = 1$ functions, we will introduce an additional number $m$ to distinguish them.  $m$ is chosen so that $| m |$ is equal to the number of nodal lines as $\varphi$ goes from 0 to $2 \pi$, for a fixed $\theta$.  Thus, $\phi_z$ has $m = 0$, while $\phi_z$ and $\phi_y$ have $| m | = 1$.  We take $m = + | m|$ if the function is symmetric with respect to $\varphi$, and $m = - | m |$ is the function of antisymmetric with respect to $\varphi$.  Thus, $m = 1$ for $\phi_x$, and $m = -1$ for $\phi_y$.  Consequently, the allowedvalues for $m$ for $l = 1$ are $l = 1 : m = - 1 , 0 , +1$.Similarly, to construct angular functions orthogonal to $\phi_0$, $\phi_x$, $\phi_y$, and $\phi_z$ requires two, or more, angular nodal planes. There are six such functions with two nodal planes, namely,\begin{eqnarray}\phi_{xy} &=& {xy \over r^2} = \sin^2 \theta \sin \varphi \cos \varphi = {1 \over 2} \sin^2 \theta \sin^2 \varphi\cr\phi_{yx} &=& {yz \over r^2} = \sin \theta \cos \theta \sin \varphi\cr\phi_{zx} &=& {zx \over r^2} = \sin \theta \cos \theta \cos \varphi\cr\phi_{x^2-y^2} &=& {x^2 - y^2 \over r^2} = \cos^2 \theta \left( \cos^2 \varphi - \sin^2 \varphi \right) = \cos^2 \theta \cos^2 \varphi\cr\phi_{y^2-z^2} &=& {y^2 - z^2 \over r^2}\cr\phi_{z^2-x^2} &=& {z^2 - x^2 \over r^2}.\end{eqnarray}Taking the sum, and the difference of the last two functions, leads to\begin{eqnarray}\phi_{z^2-x^2} + \phi_{y^2-z^2} &=& {y^2 - x^2 \over r^2} = - \phi_{x^2-y^2}\cr\phi_{z^2-x^2} - \phi_{y^2-z^2} &=& {2z^2 -x^2 - y^2 \over r^2} = {3z^3 -r^2 \over r^2} = 3 \cos^2 \theta -1.\end{eqnarray}The second function will be denoted as\begin{equation}\phi_{z^2} = 3 \cos^2 \theta - 1.\end{equation}The first function is just the negative of the $\phi_{x^2-y^2}$ function, and hence, there are only five orthogonal $l = 2$ functions.  Introducing the $m$ quantum number, we see that $\phi_{x^2-y^2}$ is $m = 2$, $\phi_{xy}$ is $m = -2$, $\phi_{zx}$ is $m = 1$, $\phi_{yz}$ is $m = - 1$, and $\phi_{z^2}$ is $m = 0$.  Of the two functions having the same $|m|$, the $\cos m \varphi$ function will always be taken as $+| m |$, and the $\sin m \varphi$ function will be taken as $- | m |$.  Thus, the allowed value of $m$ for $l = 2$ are $l = 2 : m = +2 , + 1 , 0 , -1 , -2$.  Continuing, we find seven functions with $l = 3$, nine with $l = 4$, etc.\begin{table}\caption{The complex spherical harmonics $Y_{lm}$.}\label{chap5-table1a}\begin{tabular}{ccc} \\ \hline$Y_{00}$ & = & $\sqrt{{1 \over 4 \pi}}$\cr$rY_{1{\bar 1}}$ & = & $\sqrt{{3 \over 8 \pi}}(x-iy)$\cr $rY_{10}$ & = & $\sqrt{{3 \over 4 \pi}}z$\cr$rY_{11}$ & = & $\sqrt{{3 \over 8 \pi}}(x+iy)$\cr$r^2Y_{2{\bar 2}}$ & = & $\sqrt{{5 \over 4}} \sqrt{{3 \over 8}}(x-iy)^2$\cr$r^2Y_{2{\bar 1}}$ & = & $\sqrt{{5 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{{3 \over 2}}z(x-iy)$\cr$r^2Y_{20}$ & = & $\sqrt{{5 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{{1 \over 4}}(3z^2-r^2)$\cr$r^2Y_{21}$ & = & $\sqrt{{5 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{{3 \over 2}}z(x+iy)$\cr $r^2Y_{22}$ & = & $\sqrt{{5 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{{3 \over 8}}(x+iy)^2$\cr$r^3Y_{3{\bar 3}}$ & = & $\sqrt{{7 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{{5 \over 16}}(x-iy)^3$\cr$r^3Y_{3{\bar 2}}$ & = & $\sqrt{{7 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{{15 \over 8}}z(x-iy)^2$\cr$r^3Y_{3{\bar 1}}$ & = & $\sqrt{{7 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{{3 \over 16}}(x-iy)(5z^2-r^2)$\cr$r^3Y_{30}$ & = & $\sqrt{{7 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{{1 \over 4}}z(5z^2-3r^2)$\cr$r^3Y_{31}$ & = & $\sqrt{{7 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{{3 \over 16}}(x+iy)(5z^2-r^2)$\cr$r^3Y_{32}$ & = & $\sqrt{{7 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{{15 \over 8}}(x+iy)^2$\cr$r^3Y_{33}$ & = & $\sqrt{{7 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{{5 \over 16}}(x+iy)^3$\cr\hline\end{tabular}\end{table}\begin{table}\caption{The real spherical harmonics $Z_{lm}$.}\label{chap5-table1b}\begin{tabular}{ccc} \\ \hline$Z_{00}$ & = & $Y_{00}$\cr$rZ_{11}$ & = & $\sqrt{{3 \over 4 \pi}}x$\cr$rZ_{1{\bar 1}}$ & = & $\sqrt{{3 \over 4 \pi}}y$\cr$rZ_{10}$ & = & $\sqrt{{3 \over 4 \pi}}z$\cr$r^2Z_{22}$ & = & $\sqrt{{5 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{{3 \over 4}}(x^2-y^2)$\cr$r^2Z_{2{\bar 1}}$ & = & $\sqrt{{5 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{3}xy$\cr$r^2Z_{21}$ & = & $\sqrt{{5 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{3}xz$\cr$r^2Z_{21}$ & = & $\sqrt{{5 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{3}yz$\cr$r^2Z_{20}$ & = & $\sqrt{{5 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{{1 \over 4}}(3z^2-r^2)$\cr$r^3Z_{33}$ & = & $\sqrt{{7 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{{5 \over 8}}x(x^2-3y^2)$\cr$r^3Z_{3{\bar 2}}$ & = & $\sqrt{{7 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{{5 \over 8}}y(3x^2-y^2)$\cr$r^3Z_{32}$ & = & $\sqrt{{7 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{{15 \over 4}}z(x^2-y^2)$\cr$r^3Z_{32}$ & = & $\sqrt{{7 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{15}zxy$\cr$r^3Z_{31}$ & = & $\sqrt{{7 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{{3 \over 8}}x(5z^2-r^2)$\cr$r^3Z_{31{\bar 1}}$ & = & $\sqrt{{7 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{{3 \over 8}}y(5z^2-r^2)$\cr$Z_{30}$ & = & $\sqrt{{7 \over 4 \pi}} \sqrt{{1 \over 4}}z(5z^2-3r^2)$\cr\hline\end{tabular}\\Note that a bar over a number indicates a negative number, e.g., ${\bar 3} = -3$.  $Z_{lm}$ with $m > 0$ are also denoted as $Z^c_{lm}$ and $Z_{lm}$ where $m < 0$ are denoted as $Z^s_{lm}$, cosine and sine forms, respectively.\end{table}The set of angular functions generated above, are referred to as thereal spherical harmonics $Z_{lm} ( \theta , \varphi )$, and aretabulated in Tables \ref{chap5-table1a}--\ref{chap5-table1b}. These functionshave been normalized so that\begin{equation}\int\limits_{0}^{\pi} \sin \theta d \theta \int\limits_{- \pi}^{+ \pi} d \varphi | Z_{lm} \left( \theta , \varphi \right) |^2 = 1.\end{equation}\subsection{Radial Functions}Now we will consider a wavefunction with a specific angular form, $Z_{lm} ( \theta , \varphi)$, and examine the optimum radial forms $R(r)$ of the wavefunction.  In this section, we will ignore normalization in $Z_{lm}( \theta , \varphi)$, in $R(r)$, and in the total wavefunction\begin{equation}\phi ( r , \theta , \varphi ) = R ( r ) Z_{lm} ( \theta , \varphi ) .\end{equation}In addition, we will take the nuclear charge as unity, hydrogen atom.First, we consider the $l = 0$ angular function, $Z_{lm} ( \theta , \varphi ) = 1$.  The potential energy favors concentrating the wavefunction at $r = 0$, while the kinetic energy favors spreading the wavefunction over a finite region.  The compromise is\begin{equation}R_{10} (r) = e^{-r}\label{chap5-eqno5}\end{equation}Plotting the total wavefunction\begin{equation}\varphi_{100} ( r , \theta , \varphi ) = R_{10} (r) Z_{lm} ( \theta , \varphi )\end{equation}along the z axis, leads to Figure \ref{fig5-1a}.\begin{figure}\begin{center}\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig5-1a}\end{center}\caption{}\label{fig5-1a}\end{figure}\begin{figure}\begin{center}\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig5-1b}\end{center}\caption{}\label{fig5-1b}\end{figure}\begin{figure}\begin{center}\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig5-1c}\end{center}\caption{}\label{fig5-1c}\end{figure}The first excited $l = 0$ states, denoted as $R_{20} (r)$, must beorthogonal to $R_{10} (r)$ and hence, it has the form in Figure\ref{fig5-1b}.  Forcing a radial node as in Figure \ref{fig5-1c},necessarily leads to higher gradients, for normalized wavefunctions,and hence, a higher kinetic energy.Hence, the optimum $R_{20}(r)$ orbital is much more extended than $R_{10}(r)$ in order to decrease the gradients due to the radial node.  Of course, expanding the wavefunction increases ${\bar r}$, and hence, makes the potential energy less negative.  The final orbital is\begin{equation}R_{20} (r) = \left( {1 \over 2} r - 1 \right) e^{-{1 \over 2}r}.\end{equation}Higher states have additional nodal planes.In order to refer quickly to these various solutions, we willintroduce a number $n$, defined to be one greater than the totalnumber of nodal planes, radial plus angular.  Thus, the ground statewavefunction (\ref{chap5-eqno5}) is $n = 1$.  The function $R_{20}(r)$is zero for $r = 2$ independent of $\theta$ and $\varphi$.  Thus, thewavefunction\begin{equation}\phi_{200} \left( r , \theta , \varphi \right) = R_{20} (r) Z_{lm} ( \theta , \varphi )\end{equation}has one spherical nodal surface, at $r = 2a_0$, and consequently, $n = 2$.  The next $l = 0$ state is\begin{equation}\phi_{300} = R_{30} Z_{00}\end{equation}where\begin{equation}R_{30}(r) = \left( {2 \over 27} r^2 - {2 \over 3} r+1 \right) e^{-{1 \over 2}r}\end{equation}with radial nodes at $r = 1.902$ and $r = 7.098$, note that the inner node lies close to that of $R_{20}$.\begin{figure}\begin{center}\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig5-2a}\end{center}\caption{}\label{fig5-2a}\end{figure}\begin{figure}\begin{center}\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig5-2b}\end{center}\caption{}\label{fig5-2b}\end{figure}Consider now, the functions with $l = 1$ and $m = 0$,\begin{equation}\phi ( r , \theta , \varphi ) = R ( r ) Z_{10} ( \theta , \varphi ) = R (r) \cos \theta .\end{equation}In this case, we must have $R(r) \rightarrow 0$ and $r \rightarrow 0$,since otherwise $\phi$ would be multi-valued at $r = 0$.  Thus, thesmoothest allowed radial function, i.e., the lowest energy, is of theform in Figure \ref{fig5-2a}.Combining this radial form with $\cos \theta$, and plotting along theZ axis, leads to the form in Figure \ref{fig5-2b}, a function with oneplanar nodal surface, the xy plane.  Thus, this state has $n = 2$.The precise form of the radial function is\begin{equation}R_{21} = re^{-{1 \over 2}r}\end{equation}and the total wavefunction is\begin{equation}\phi_{210} = r \cos \theta e^{-{1 \over 2}r} = ze^{-{1 \over 2}r}.\end{equation}Just as for the $R_{20}(r)$ function, the presence of the nodal plane in $R_{21}$ leads to an increase in the spatial extent of the wavefunction. Since the three $l = 1$ functions are equivalent in shape, differing only in the orientation of the nodal plane, the radial function isindependent of $m$.The radial function for the next higher $l = 1$ states, $n = 3$, must have an additional radial nodal plane in order to be orthogonal to $R_{21}$, as in Figure \ref{fig5-3a}.  The precise form is\begin{equation}R_{31} (r) = r \left( {1 \over 6} r - 1 \right) e^{-{1 \over 3}r}.\end{equation}Combining $R_{31}(r)$ with the angular function $Z_{10} (\theta , \varphi)$ leads to\begin{equation}\phi_{310} ( r , \theta , \varphi ) = z \left( 1 - {1 \over 6} r \right) e^{-{1 \over 3}r}.\end{equation}Thus, $\phi_{310}$ has two nodal surfaces, one is spherical at $r = 6a_0$, and the other is planar, the xy plane, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig5-3b}.\begin{figure}\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig5-3a}\caption{}\label{fig5-3a}\end{figure}\begin{figure}\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig5-3b}\caption{}\label{fig5-3b}\end{figure}For higher angular momenta, $l$, we find that $R_{nl}(r) \rightarrow r^l$ as $r \rightarrow 0$, in order that $\phi ( r , \theta , \varphi )$be single valued at $r = 0$.  The lowest $n$, no radial nodal surfaces, is $n = l + 1$, leading to the general form\begin{equation}R_{nl} (r) = r^l e^{- {1 \over n}r} ~~~~~~~\left( n = l + 1 \right)\end{equation}see the next section for derivation.The final energy of these states is given by\begin{equation}E = - {1 \over 2} {Z^2 \over n^2} .\end{equation}Thus, increasing the number of nodal surfaces ($n$) leads to anincrease of the energy (less negative). The unexpected result here isthat the energy is determined only by the total number of nodalsurfaces, independent of whether they are radial or angular. Thisresult is special to the Coulomb potential $V(r) = - {Z \over r}$.For a more general potential $V(r)$, the energy depends on $n$ and $l$.\subsection{Quantitative Aspects of Hydrogen Atom}Using atomic units, the Hamiltonian for the hydrogen atom becomes\begin{equation}H = - {1 \over 2} \nabla^2 - {Z \over r} .\label{chap5-eqno6}\end{equation} To solve for the eigenfunctions of (\ref{chap5-eqno6}), it isconvenient to transform to spherical polar coordinates where theLaplacian becomes\begin{equation}\nabla^2 = {\partial^2 \over \partial r^2} + {2 \over r} {\partial \over \partial r} - {{\hat l}^2 \over r^2}\label{chap5-eqno7}\end{equation}and\begin{equation}{\hat l}^2 = {\hat l}^2_x + {\hat l}^2_y + {\hat l}^2_x\end{equation}is the angular momentum operator.  The eigenfunctions of $H$ can then be written as\begin{equation}H\Psi_{nlm} = E_{nlm} \Psi_{nlm} ,\end{equation}where\begin{equation}\Psi_{nlm} = R_{nl} (r) Y_{lm} ( \theta ,\varphi )\label{chap5-eqno8}\end{equation} and $Y_{lm}(\theta , \varphi)$ are the complex spherical harmonicfunctions (angular momentum eigenfunctions) shown in Tables\ref{chap5-table1a}--\ref{chap5-table1b}.  The states given here allhave energies $E < 0$.  For $E \geq 0$ the eigenfunctions of(\ref{chap5-eqno2}) are not square-integrable, and we will discussthem no further.  The spherical harmonic functions satisfy\begin{equation}{\hat l}^2 Y_{lm} ( \theta , \varphi ) = l ( l + 1 ) Y_{lm} ( \theta ,\varphi)\label{chap5-eqno9a}\end{equation}\begin{equation}{\hat l}_z Y_{lm} ( \theta , \varphi ) = mY_{lm} ( \theta , \varphi )\label{chap5-eqno9b}\end{equation}and are simple combinations of the real spherical harmonics, $Z_{lm}$.  The $Z_{lm}$ are eigenfunctions of ${\hat l}^2$ but not of ${\hat l}_z$.  That is, ${\hat l}_zZ_{lm} \not= mZ_{lm}$, so that the $m$ in $Z_{lm}$ is not strictly the angular momentum projection.  The real form is more convenient for molecular systems. Although $l$ and $m$ refer to  the number of angular nodal planes, $l$ is generally referred to as the \emph{angular momentum}, and $m$ is referred to as the \emph{angularmomentum projection} (along the z axis).Using (\ref{chap5-eqno6}), (\ref{chap5-eqno7}), and(\ref{chap5-eqno8}) in (\ref{chap5-eqno9}), leads to the differentialequation for the radial function, $R(r)$,\begin{equation}\left[ - {1 \over 2} \left( {\partial^2 \over \partial r^2} + {2 \over r} {\partial \over \partial r} - {l(l+1) \over r^2} \right) - {Z \over r} \right] R_{nl} (r) = E_n R_{nl} (r),\label{chap5-eqno10}\end{equation}where the energy is given by\begin{equation}E_n = - {Z^2 \over 2n^2}\end{equation}Thus, the energy is independent of the angular momentum, $l$.  However, only $l \leq n - 1$ are allowed for any given $n$.In solving (\ref{chap5-eqno10}), it is customary to substitute\begin{equation}P_{nl} (r) = r R_{nl} (r)\end{equation}so that (\ref{chap5-eqno10}) becomes\begin{equation}\left[ - {1 \over 2} {d^2 \over dr^2} + V_l (r) \right] P_{nl} (r) = E_n P_{nl} (r)\label{chap5-eqno11}\end{equation}where\begin{equation}V_l (r) = {l(l+1) \over 2r^2} - {Z \over r}.\label{chap5-eqno12}\end{equation}This is just the Schr\"odinger equation for a particle moving in a one-dimensional potential $V_l(r)$.  The potential depends upon the value of the angular momentum, leading to a different sequence (denoted by $n$) of solutions for each angular momentum.The lowest solution for each angular momentum is easy.  It has the form\begin{equation}R(r) = r^l e^{- \zeta r}\end{equation}or\begin{equation}P(r)  = r^{l+1} e^{- \zeta r}\end{equation}Substituting into (\ref{chap5-eqno11}), we obtain\begin{equation}\left\{ {(l+1)l \over 2r^2} + \zeta {(l+1) \over r} - {1 \over 2} \zeta^2 + {l(l+1) \over 2r^2} - {Z \over r} - E \right\} P_{nl}(r) = 0\end{equation}and hence,\begin{equation}E = - {1 \over 2} \zeta^2\label{chap5-eqno13a}\end{equation}where\begin{equation}\zeta = {Z \over n}\label{chap5-eqno13b}\end{equation}and $n = l + 1$.  Substituting (\ref{chap5-eqno13b}) into(\ref{chap5-eqno13a}) leads, then, to the total energy\begin{equation}E_n = - {Z^2 \over 2n^2}.\end{equation}Higher energy solutions are obtained corresponding to each largervalue of $n$.  The other solutions of (\ref{chap5-eqno10}) are listedin Tables \ref{chap5-table2}--\ref{chap5-table3}, using the real formof the angular functions, and plotted in Figures \ref{fig5-4} and\ref{fig5-5}, for the $n = 1 , 2 , 3 ,$ and $n = 4$ states,respectively.\begin{figure}\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig5-4}\caption{Contour plots of selected $n = 1,2$, and 3 atomic orbitals, $Z = 1$, i.e., for the hydrogen atom.

In Figure\ref{fig5-4}, all but one plot is in the plane passing through theorigin and lying in the $xz$ plane, the exception is in the $xy$plane.  Each contour line corresponds to a particular amplitude forthis plane.  The lines with long dashes, indicate zero amplitude whilesolid and dotted lines indicate positive and negative amplitude,respectively.  When comparing a bunch of orbitals, as in Figures\ref{fig5-4} and \ref{fig5-5}, we will generally use the same scaleand will always use the same amplitudes for all plots.Two standard conventions are used for spacing the amplitudes being plotted.  Our normal convention involves use of a constant increment in contour amplitudes.  Thus, in Figure \ref{fig5-5}, contours corresponding to $\pm$0.0125, $\pm$0.0075, $\pm$0.0050, $\pm$0.0025, 0.00 are plotted. This is appropriate when all orbitals being shown have similar sizes, in Figure \ref{fig5-5} all orbitals correspond to $n = 4$, and hence,are of nearly the same size. The other convention, referred to as alog plot, involves a constant factor in space the contours.  Thus, inFigure \ref{fig5-4}, the contours corresponding to 0.0, 0.0025,0.0050, 0.0100, 0.0200, 0.0400, etc., are plotted.  This isappropriate for showing orbitals of widely disparate sizes, as inFigure \ref{fig5-4} where $n = 1$, $n = 2$, and $n = 3$ orbitals areshown.For the $1s$ and $2p$ orbitals, each contour amplitude occurs once andinterpretation is straightforward.  For the $2s$, and certain otherorbitals, interpretation is a little more difficult since there aremaxima with $r \not= 0$, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig5-6}.  Inthis case, the presence and position of the maximum is not obviouswithout careful examination of the positions of the nodal lines, e.g.,examine the 4s orbital in Figure 5.\begin{figure}\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig5-6}\caption{Comparison of lineand contour plots for a 2s-like orbital (the orbital plotted is not a2s orbital, but has been modified to go to zero at $r = 5a_0$).  Notethat with the contour plot, the maximum is indicated by a wide spacebetween positive contours.}\label{fig5-6}\end{figure}\subsection{Sizes of the Orbitals}The bound eigenstates of a particle moving in a Coulomb potential\begin{equation}V(r) = - {Z \over r},\end{equation}lead to total kinetic and potential energies, $T$ and $V$, that are related by $2T = - V$.  Since the total energy is $E = T + V$, we have $E = - T$ and $E = 1/2V$.  This result is called the \emph{virial theorem}. Since\begin{equation}E = - {Z^2 \over 2n^2} ,\end{equation}we find that\begin{equation}T = {Z^2 \over n^2}\label{chap5-eqno14}\end{equation}and\begin{equation}V = - {Z^2 \over n^2}.\end{equation}    Since the potential energy of a particle in state $\phi$ is given by\begin{equation}V = \langle \phi | - {Z \over r} | \phi \rangle ,\end{equation}we will define the average distance of the electron from the nucleus, ${\bar r}$, as\begin{equation}V = - {Z \over r} .\end{equation}Thus, ${\bar r}$ is the radius for a classical particle to have the same potential energy.  This definition leads to\begin{equation}{1 \over {\bar r}} = \langle \phi | {1 \over r} | \phi \rangle ,\end{equation}and hence, from (\ref{chap5-eqno14}) we obtain\begin{equation}{\bar r} = {n^2 \over Z} .\end{equation}Thus, for the hydrogen atom, the average radial distance ${\bar r}$ for the $n = 1 , 2, 3 , 4$, states are ${\bar r} = 1a_0 = 0.53$\AA, $4a_0 = 2.1$\AA, $9a_0 = 4.7$\AA, and $16a_0 = 8.5$\AA,respectively.  Since the bond length of the H$_2$ molecules is $1.4a_0 = 0.75$\AA, and a typical CH bond length is $2.1a_0 = 1.0$\AA, we see that even the $n = 2$ excited H orbitals are much larger than a bond, and the $n = 3$ excited orbitals are very large indeed.  Considering a fixed $n$, say $n = 1$, and varying nuclear charge $Z$, we see that the largeatoms have much smaller orbitals, with the average radius of the ls orbital of C$^{5+}$ being one-sixth that of hydrogen.With the definition of size used above, the states of various $l$, but the same $n$, have the same size.  Other definitions of size, say\begin{equation}{\bar r} = \langle \phi | r | \phi \rangle\end{equation}or\begin{equation}{\bar r} = \sqrt{\langle \phi | r^2 | \phi \rangle},\end{equation}lead to slightly different ${\bar r}$ for different $l$ with the same $n$.  However, all such definitions lead to overall sizes comparable to(\ref{chap5-eqno12}). In Figure \ref{fig5-7}(a), we present line plots of the $1s$, $2s$ and$3s$ orbitals of hydrogen, but with the sign changes for $2s$.  Theseorbitals are not normalized, rather the amplitude at the nucleus wastaken to be the same value for each orbital. Note that in the regionnear the nucleus, $r < la_0$, the $\psi_{2s}$ and $\phi_{3s}$ orbitalsare very similar to $\phi_{1s}$.  For $r < 4a_0$, the outer maximum in$\psi_{2s}$, the $\psi_{3s}$ orbital is very similar to $\psi_{2s}$.These observations are general and result from the orthogonalityconditions on the higher energy orbitals.\begin{figure}\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig5-7}\caption{(a) The amplitudes of the 1s, 2s, and 3s orbitals ofhydrogen (sign changed for 2s).  Also included is a plot ofthe potential energy, $V = - 1/r$ (dotted line).  The line with thelong dashes is the zero of energy for the potential.  For each state,a solid horizontal line is drawn at the energy for the orbital.  Theorbital is then plotted with this line as the origin.  The orbitalsare not normalized.  (b) The $r \phi$ for the 1s, 2s, and 3slevels.  Since $(r \phi)^2$ is the probability density for an electronat distance $r$ from the nucleus, the figure provides the relativeamplitude of being at various $r$.}\label{fig5-7}\end{figure}From Figure \ref{fig5-3a} it would appear that the $\psi_{2s}$ and$\psi_{3s}$ orbitals are concentrated mainly in the same region as$\phi_{1s}$. However, in spherical coordinates, the volume element forthe radial integration is $d \tau = r^2 dr$, and hence, theprobability density for the electron to be a distance $r$ from thenucleus is\begin{equation}r^2 \phi^2 ( r ) = [ r \phi ( r ) ]^2 .\end{equation}The quantity $r \phi (r)$ is plotted in Figure \ref{fig5-7}(b), wherewe see that the probability density is a maximum at $r = 1a_0$ for the$1s$ orbital, $r = 5a_0$ for the $2s$ orbital, and $r = 13a_0$ for the$3s$ orbital.Given an energy\begin{equation}E_n = - {1 \over 2n^2} ,\end{equation}the classical motion of an electron about a nucleus of charge 1, would beconfined within the radius\begin{equation}r_{cl} = {1 \over n^2} = 2 {\bar r} .\end{equation}From Figure \ref{fig5-7}(b), we see that the maximum probabilityamplitude always occurs within this classically allowed region.However, there are quite significant amplitudes in the classicallyforbidden region.From (\ref{chap5-eqno12}) we see that if $l \not= 0$, the potentialbecomes positively infinite for $r = 0$.  As a result, thewavefunctions for $l \not= 0$ must go to zero for $r = 0$.  Thepotentials (\ref{chap5-eqno12}) for $l = 0$, 1, and 2 are shown inFigure \ref{fig5-8} along with the amplitudes of the $1s$, $2p$, and$3s$ orbitals.\begin{figure}\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig5-8}\caption{Comparison of $1s$, $2p$, and $3s$ orbitals and thepotentials, $V_l$, including centrifugal terms.}\label{fig5-8}\end{figure}\section{The Aufbau Principle of Atoms}In this section, we develop the Aufbau principle for atoms.  This is based uponthe sequence of states for the H atom, except that inclusion of average electron-electron repulsion effects of many-electron atoms, leads toan ordering of orbitals in this sequence\begin{tabular}{lll} \\Row 0 & $1s$ & H to He\crRow 1 & $2s$, $3p$ & Li to Ne\crRow 2 & $3s$, $3p$ & Na to Ar\crRow 3 & $4s$, $3d$, $4p$ & K to Kr\crRow 4 & $5s$, $4d$, $5p$ & Rb to Xe\crRow 5 & $6s$, $4f$, $5d$, $6p$ & Cs to Rn\crRow 6 & $7s$, $5f$, $6d$, $7p$ & Fr to -\cr\end{tabular}\noindentwhere $1s$ is lowest and large gaps occur between rows. These rowswill be denoted as indicated with Li-Ne as the \emph{first row} (thisis convenient when discussing periodic trends).  The schematic energydiagram, the \emph{Aufbau diagram}, is given in Figure\ref{fig5-9}. The ground state of a Z electron atom is thusconstructed by filling these orbitals, 2 electrons per spatialorbital, starting with the lowest and working up.\begin{figure}\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig5-9}\caption{The Aufbau diagram.  Alsoindicated is the element (Z in parentheses) for which a givenlevel (and all deeper levels) is filled. The components for differentshells are also listed spearately.}\label{fig5-9}\end{figure}If the highest occupied orbitals are in the r$th$ row, then allorbitals of the earlier rows are too small to play a special role inbonding and are referred to as \emph{core orbitals}. The variousoccupied orbitals of the r$th$ row are referred to as \emph{valenceorbitals}.  States in different rows, but with the same occupation ofvalence orbitals, have similar chemical properties leading to the\emph{periodic table}, as indicated in Table \ref{chap5-table4} and\ref{chap5-table5}.The $d$ and $f$ orbitals complicate the above description. Thus, forthe third row, the $3d$ orbitals are approximately 30 \% the sizeof the $4s$ and $4p$ orbitals.  As a result, they play a somewhatsmaller role in the chemistry.  For atoms in which the $d$ and $f$orbitals are empty, or full, we can generally ignore the $d$ and $f$orbitals in considering the chemistry.  Thus, Se is analogous to Sdespite the $(3d)^{10}$ configuration in Se.  Cases with partiallyoccupied $d$ or $f$ shells are chemically analogous only to othercases with similar partial occupations.The valence orbitals for H through Xe are shown in Figure 10.  The ionizationpotentials and electron affinities for various atoms are shown inTables \ref{chap5-table4} and \ref{chap5-table5}.\begin{table}\caption{}\label{chap5-table4}%% Warning!

However, for the Li and Becolumns, an extra piece was added, the vertical dotted line showswhere the cutoff would have been. The same vertical scale is used forall atoms of the same column. However, different columns may havedifferent scales, all plots in the same figure have the same verticalscale.  For the transition elements, Sc-Zn columns, the $4s$ orbitalhas been multiplied by three, indicated by *3 in the figure.\begin{figure}\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig5-10a}\caption{The valence orbitals of alkali and alkali earth metals.

For $1s$\begin{equation}E = - {1 \over 2h} = - 13.6 {\rm eV}\end{equation}For 2s, 2p\begin{equation}E = - {1 \over 8} h = - 3.40 {\rm eV}\end{equation}For 3s, 3p, and 3d\begin{equation}E = - {1 \over 18} h = - 1.51 {\rm eV}\end{equation}and for 4s, 4p, 4d, and 4f\begin{equation}E = - {1 \over 32} h = - 0.85 {\rm eV}\end{equation}with all energies relative to a free electron, plus a proton.  Except for scaling of all energies by $Z^2$, the same results are obtained for a nucleus of arbitrary $Z$, still one electron, of course.Now we want to consider a many-electron atom. In the simpleapproximation we might completely ignore electron repulsion effects,placing the electrons in the lowest orbitals, consistent with thePauli principle.  In this case, the $Z$ electron atom would be builtup by placing two electrons in the $1s$ orbital, the next eightelectrons in $2s$ and $2p$ orbitals, the next 18 into the $3s$, $3p$,and $3d$ orbitals, etc.  In this model, there would be a sharp breakafter filling each $n$ shell, since the next electron would go in amuch higher orbital. Thus, $Z = 2, 10, 28,$ and 60 would beparticularly stable and ureactive. These $Z$ correspond to He, Ne, Ni,and Nd, whereas in fact it is He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe that areparticularly stable and unreactive.  Consequently, we must includeelectron-electron interaction effects.Rather than include these electron repulsion effects exactly, we will include them in an average way.  Each orbital will be allowed to adjust to this average electric field due to the electrons in the other orbitals.\subsubsection{Effects of Shielding}Consider, first, the case of a nucleus of charge $Z$ with twoelectrons in a $1s$ orbital.  Neglecting electron-electron repulsion,this optimum $1s$ orbital is $e^{-Zr}$.  Including electron repulsion,the optimum orbital is $e^{-Z^*r}$ where $Z^* = Z - 5/16$.  Thus, theaverage effect of one $1s$ electron upon the other, is equivalent tocancelling (or \emph{shielding}) 5/16 of a positive charge of the nucleus.Now consider the Li atom. Two electrons go into the $1s$ orbital, onewith each spin, and the remaining electron goes into an $n = 2$orbital, $2s$ or $2p$ orbital. If the density for the $n = 2$ orbitalwere entirely outside the density of the $1s$ orbital, then theoptimum $Z^*$ for the $1s$ orbital would be unchanged by the $n = 2$orbital, while the $1s$ electrons would completely shield two protonsfrom the $n = 2$ orbital.  Thus, we would obtain\begin{equation}Z^*_{1s} = 3 - {5 \over 16} = 2.69\end{equation}\begin{equation}Z^*_{2s} = Z^*_{2p} = 3 - 2 = 1.\end{equation}In fact, this is a good approximation for the $2p$ orbital since thisorbital goes to zero at the nucleus. However, the $2s$ orbital isnonzero at the nucleus and has a significant density within the $1s$region.  As a result, the $1s$ electrons only partially shield thenucleus.  The result is, for Li\begin{equation}Z^*_{1s} = 3 - {5 \over 16} = 2.69\end{equation}\begin{equation}Z^*_{2s} = 3 - 1.72 = 1.28\end{equation}\begin{equation}Z^*_{2p} = 3 - 2 = 1.00 .\end{equation}Since the nucleus is less completely shielded from the $2s$ orbital than from $2p$, the $2s$ orbital is more strongly bound than $2p$, and hence, the ground state of Li is $(1s)^2 (2s)^1$, while $(1s)^2 (2p)^1$ is the first excited states, 2 eV excitation energy.Similar differential shielding effects lead to a splitting of the various $nl$ states of H atom, having the same $n$ with the result that for many-electron atoms, the energies satisfy\begin{equation}2s < 2p ,\end{equation}\begin{equation}3s < 3p < 3d ,\end{equation}\begin{equation}4s < 4p < 4d < 4f ,\end{equation}etc.  In all cases, higher $l$ leads to less penetration of the core,resulting in greater shielding by the core orbitals, leading therebyto higher energy.  These $l$-splitting effects depend somewhat uponthe precise occupation of the various orbitals, but the ground statesof most atoms can be qualitatively explained by the simple\emph{Aufbau diagram} in Figure \ref{fig5-9}.  Magnitudes of theseparations in the Aufbau diagram are not to scale.As illustrated, the $l$-splitting is sometimes larger than the $n$ splitting, resulting in the general sequences\begin{eqnarray}&& 1s,\cr&& 2s,2p,\cr&& 3s,3p\cr&& 4s,3d,4p\cr&& 5s,4d,5p,\cr&& 6s,4f,5d,6p\cr&& 7s,5f,6d,7p\label{chap5-eqno15}\end{eqnarray}where we have used separate rows to indicate a big break after filling the $np$ orbital of each row.\subsubsection{The Aufbau Principle}Using the ordering of levels in (\ref{chap5-eqno15}), or Figure\ref{fig5-9}, leads to the Aufbau principle. For an atom of atomicnumber $Z$, we fill in the lowest orbitals in Figure \ref{fig5-9},allowing 2 electrons per orbital, until all electrons are usedup. Counting spatial degeneracies, this allows two electrons for $s$shell, six electrons for $p$ shell, ten electrons for $d$ shells, andfourteen electrons for $f$ shells.  For example, this leads to\begin{eqnarray}Z &=& 2, {\rm He} : (1s)^2\crZ &=& 6, {\rm C} : ( {\rm He} )   (2s)^2 (2p)^2\crZ &=& 10, {\rm Ne} : ( {\rm He} ) (2s)^2 (2p)^6\crZ &=& 18, {\rm Ar} : ( {\rm Ne} ) (3s)^2 (3p)^6\crZ &=& 26, {\rm Fe} : ( {\rm Ar} ) (4s)^2 (3d)^6\crZ &=& 36, {\rm Kr} : ( {\rm Ar} ) (4s)^2 (3d)^{10} (4p)^6\crZ &=& 54, {\rm Xe} : ( {\rm Kr} ) (5s)^2 (4d)^{10} (5p)^6\crZ &=& 86, {\rm Rn} : ( {\rm Xe} ) (6s)^2 (4f)^{14} (5d)^{10} (6p)^6,\end{eqnarray}where the configuration of the core electrons is indicated by the corresponding atomic symbol, for example (Ar) indicates the configuration of, ground state, Ar.  Large gaps occur after the $1s$, $2p$, $3p$, $4p$, $5p$, and $6p$, shells are filled, resulting in particularly unreactive and stable atoms, the noble gases of He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, and Rn.\begin{table}\caption{The ground configurations for atoms H-Ar.

The ordering of thelevels depends somewhat upon the $Z$, and the state of ionization ofthe atoms and exceptions of the simple Aufbau principle, do occur evenfor ground state atoms.  In Table \ref{chap5-table6} we complied theconfigurations for the ground state of each atom.  Exceptions from thesimple Aufbau principle are Cr, Cu, Nb, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, La, Gd, Pt, Au,Ac, Th, Pa, U, Np, Cm.\subsection{The Periodic Table}The ionization potentials, IP, of the elements, are listed in Table\ref{chap5-table4}.  Here we see a general build-up of ionizationpotentials with $Z$, but with sudden drops after He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe,and Rn. These elements, the noble gases, involve completely filledshells and are particularly inert and unreactive. The elementsimmediately after a noble gas, Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, and Fr, referred toas the alkali metals, are all easily ionized, are unit reactive andtend to become positively charge in bonding to other elements. Theelements immediately preceding the inert gases, H, F, Cl, Br, I, andAt, all have large ionization potentials and, except for H, tend tobecome negatively charge upon bonding to other elements.  Excepting H,these elements are referred to as halogens. Laying out the elements insuccessive rows, with the final elements of each row being an inertgas atom, leads to the periodic tables of Tables 4 and 5, whichautomatically group into columns, those elements with similarchemistry. The elements of each column of these tables, have a similarvalence configuration, and hence, similar chemistry.In Figures \ref{fig5-10a}--\ref{fig5-10g} we showed the shapes of thevalence orbitals of H-Xe, arranged in the pattern dictated by theperiodic table.  Note that rather than writing the orbitals\begin{equation}\phi_{nlm} = R_{nl} (r) Z_{lm} ( \theta , \varphi ) ,\end{equation}the orbitals plotted in these figures, are $r \phi_{nlm}$.  That is,we show $ns$, $np_z$, $nd_{z^2}$, etc., and a factor of $r$ has beenincluded. Since the normalization integral is\begin{equation}1 = \int r^2 drd \Omega | \phi_{nlm} |^2 = \int drd \Omega | r \phi_{nlm} |^2 ,\end{equation}the magnitude of $(r \phi)^2$ provides the relative probability of the electron being in the spherical shell, at a distance $r$ from the nucleus.There are three points to note in these figures. First, the orbitalalways contract as we go from left to right in the same row of theperiodic table.  In the next section, we will see that this is due toincomplete shielding of the additional nuclear charge by theadditional valence electrons.  Second, the orbitals generally, but notalways, get larger as we go down a column.  Third, the $3d$ orbitalsare much more compact than $4s$, and the $4d$ orbitals are much morecompact than $5s$.  However, the relative sizes are less disparate inthe fourth Pd row, than in the third Ni row.\subsection{Shielding and Orbitals Sizes}\subsubsection{Shielding}There are various ways of defining shielding. For example, we might write theexperimental ionization potential, from the $nl$ orbital, as\begin{equation}\mathrm{IP}_{nl} = {(Z^\mathrm{eff})^2 \over 2n^2}\end{equation}where\begin{equation}Z^\mathrm{eff} = Z - \Sigma\end{equation}and $\Sigma$ is the shielding.  There are some ambiguities with this, since the ionization potentials, from deeper orbitals, are not always known experimentally.As an alternative, in this section, we have used the result of theoretical calculations.  Optimizing the scale factor $\zeta_{nl}$, for Slater basis functions\begin{equation}r^n e^{- \zeta_{nl}r}\end{equation}minimum basis set, we define the shielding $\Sigma_{nl}$ such that\begin{equation}Z^\mathrm{eff}_{nl} = n \zeta_{nl} = Z - \Sigma_{nl} .\end{equation}The shielding $\Sigma_{nl}$ is fitted as\begin{equation}\Sigma_{nl} = \sum_{{\bar n}{\bar l}} N_{{\bar n}{\bar l}} \sigma_{{\bar n}{\bar l},nl},\end{equation}where $N_{{\bar n}{\bar l}}$ is the number of electrons in the ${{\barn}{\bar l}}$ orbital, but excluding $nl$, and individual contributions$\sigma_{{\bar n}{\bar l},nl}$ are assumed independent of this atom.The results are in Table \ref{chap5-table7}.  In fact, the shieldingcontributions $\sigma_{{\bar n}{\bar l},nl}$ should be allowed todepend upon the particular atom, and even upon the state of that atom.However, the fixed shielding constants are of some use for qualitativearguments.\begin{table}\caption{Shielding effects}\label{chap5-table7}\begin{tabular}{cl}\\ \hlineOrbital & Shielding due to electrons of various shells\cr$1s$ & $\sigma_{1s} = 0.31$\cr$2s$ & $\sigma_{He} = 1.72, \sigma_{2s} = 0.36, \sigma_{2p} = 0.36$\cr$2p$ & $\sigma_{He} = 2.00, \sigma_{2s} = 0.30, \sigma_{2p} = 0.33$\cr$3s$ & $\sigma_{Ne} = 9.49, \sigma_{3s} = 0.20, \sigma_{3p} = 0.26$\cr$3p$ & $\sigma_{Ne} = 8.89, \sigma_{3p} = 0.25, \sigma_{3p} = 0.37$\cr$4s$ & $\sigma_{Ar} = 15.50, \sigma_{3d} = 0.84, \sigma_{4s} = 0.10, \sigma_{4p} = 0.11$\cr$3d$ & $\sigma_{Ar} = 13.87, \sigma_{3d} = 0.25, \sigma_{4s} = 0, \sigma_{4p} = 0.13$\cr$4p$ & $\sigma_{Ar} = 15.68, \sigma_{3d} = 0.89, \sigma_{4s} = 0.10, \sigma_{4p} = 0.29$\cr\hline\end{tabular}\\These values were deduced from Clementi and Raimondi.$^4$  Using the valence orbitals of the ground configuration, the optimum $\zeta_{nl}$ was converted into an effective charge defined by\begin{equation}Z^* = n \zeta_{nl} = Z - \sum_{i} \sigma_1.\end{equation}These $\sigma_i$ reproduce the optimum $Z^*$ to approximately 0.1.\end{table}Three important points to note are:\begin{enumerate}\item For the $2s$ orbital $\sigma_{{\rm He}} = 1.72$, whereas for the$2p$ orbital $\sigma_{{\rm He}} =$ 2.00. Thus, the $2s$ orbitalpenetrate the He core more than the $2p$ orbital.\item For the transition metals, the $3d$ orbitals penetrate the Ar core more thanthe $4s$ and $4p$ orbitals, $\sigma_{{\rm Ar}} = 13.87$ for $3d$ compared to 15.50 and 15.68 for $4s$ and $4$p. This isexpected, since the $3s$ and $3p$ orbitals of the Ar core have the same $n$ as the $3d$ orbital.  \item The $3d$ orbitals are very effective in shielding the $4s$ and $4p$ orbitals, $\sigma = 0.84$ and0.89, respectively, but not effective in shielding each other, $\sigma = 0.25$.\end{enumerate}\subsubsection{Orbital Sizes}The hydrogen orbitals have a size\begin{equation}{\bar r}_{nl} = {n^2 \over Z}\end{equation}   in atomic units.  For many-electron atoms, we can estimate the size from $Z^*$ using\begin{equation}{\bar r}_{nl} = {n^2 \over Z^*}.\label{chap5-eqno16}\end{equation}   Thus, for Li atom\begin{equation}{\bar r}_{1s} = {1 \over 2.69} = 0.37 a_0 = 0.20 {\rm \AA}\end{equation}and\begin{equation}{\bar r}_{2s} = {4 \over 1.28} = 3.137 a_0 = 1.65. {\rm \AA}\end{equation}Since the $2s$ orbital is eight times are large as the $1s$ orbital, it is the $2s$ orbital that will be important in the chemistry of Li compounds. On the other hand, $2s$ and $2p$ orbitals are of comparable size, and both set of orbitals must be included in analyzing bonding in first row atoms, Li-Ne.  Thus, for theseatoms, the $2s$ and $2p$ orbitals are referred to as \emph{valence orbitals}.Because of incomplete shielding, the effective charge seen by thevalence orbitals, increases with $Z$.  Hence, the orbitals sizedecreases with increasing $Z$.  For example, the $2s$ orbitals seeeffective charges of 1.28, 1.92, 2.28, 2.64, 3.00, 3.36, 4.00, and4.64, as we go from Li to Ne.  The result is a marked decrease in thesize of the $2s$ orbital.  Using (\ref{chap5-eqno16}), we expect the$2s$ orbital of Li to be $\approx 4.64/1.28 = 3.6$ times as large asthe $2s$ orbital of Ne.  Indeed, as shown in Figures\ref{fig5-10a}--\ref{fig5-10g}, this is approximately the case. Thesame effects occur also for the $2p$ orbitals.The sequence Na-Ar behaves similarly to Li-Ne. The valence orbitals are $3s$ and $3p$, and they also contract as we move to the right, in the periodic table.Now consider the K atom.  Adding an electron to Ar, we could put it ineither a $3d$ or a $4s$ orbital.  From Table \ref{chap5-table7}, the $4s$and $3d$ orbitals should have\begin{equation}Z^\mathrm{eff}_{4s} = 19 - 15.50 = 3.50\end{equation}\begin{equation}Z^\mathrm{eff}_{4s} = 19 - 13.87 = 5.13 .\end{equation}Thus, using (\ref{chap5-eqno16})\begin{equation}r_{3d} = {9 \over 5.13} = 1.75 a_0\end{equation}\begin{equation}r_{4s} = {16 \over 3.50} = 4.57 a_0\end{equation}we see that the $4s$ orbitals is approximately 2.5 times as large as the $3d$ orbital. This trend remains valid through the transition elements. Thus, for Ni, $s^2d^8$, we have\begin{equation}Z^\mathrm{eff}_{4s} = 28 - 22.3 = 5.7\end{equation}\begin{equation}Z^\mathrm{eff}_{3d} = 28 - 15.6 = 12.4\end{equation}leading to\begin{equation}r_{3d} = .73 a_0\end{equation}\begin{equation}r_{4s} = 2.80 a_0 .\end{equation}    Considering\begin{equation}Z^\mathrm{eff} = 3.5\end{equation}for K with\begin{equation}Z^\mathrm{eff}_{4s} = 5.7\end{equation}for Ni, we see that there is not a major contraction of the $4s$ orbital, as we go from K through the transition metals; see Figures \ref{fig5-10a}--\ref{fig5-10g}.  The reason is that the $3d$ orbital is very much smaller than the $4s$ orbital, so that each additional $3d$ electron nearlycompletely shields the corresponding increase in nuclear charge.  Onthe other hand, for Sc\begin{equation}Z^\mathrm{eff}_{3d} = 21 - 13.87 = 7.13 ,\end{equation}while for Ni\begin{equation}Z^\mathrm{eff}_{3d} = 12.4 ,\end{equation}leading to a decrease of 7.13/12.40 = 58 \% in the size of the $3d$ orbital from Sc to Ni.\subsection{Special Points About Transition Metals}The Aufbau principle implies the $4s$ orbital is filled first, and then, the $3d$ shell.  However, for all elements K through Zn, the $4s$ orbital is the easiest to ionize.  This apparent contradiction will be examined next.\begin{table}\caption{IPs from various states of K, Ca, and Sc.}\label{chap5-table8}\begin{tabular}{clrrrr}\\ \hline& Orbital$^c$ & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Energy$^d$} & $Z_\mathrm{eff}^a$ &$\delta^b$ \\& & eV & h \\K   & 4s & -4.34 & -0.1595 & 2.26 & 2.23 \\    & 4p & -2.73 & -0.1003 & 1.79 & 1.77 \\    & 5s & -1.73 & -0.0636 & 1.78 & 2.20 \\    & 3d & -1.67 & -0.0614 & 1.05 & 0.15 \\Ca$^+$ & 4s & -11.87 & -0.4362 & 3.74 \\       & 3d & -10.17 & -0.3738 & 2.59 \\       & 4p & -8.73  & -0.3208 & 3.20 \\Sc$^{++}$ & 3d & -24.75 & -0.9096 & 4.05 \\          & 4s & -21.58 & -0.7931 & 5.04 \\          & 4p & -17.01 & -0.6251 & 4.47 \\Sc$^+$    & (3d)(4s) $^3$D & -12.89 & -0.4737 & 3.89 \\          & (3d)$^2$ $^3$F & -12.28 & -0.4513 & 2.85 \\	  & (3d)(4p) $^1$D$^0$ & -9.66 & -0.3550 & 3.37 \\Sc	  & (3d)(4s)$^2$ $^2$D & -6.56 & -0.2411 & 2.78 \\          & (3d)$^2$(4s) $^4$F & -5.12 & -0.1882 & 1.84 \\	  & (3d)(4s)(4p) $^4$F$^0$ & -4.59 & -0.1687 & 2.32 \\	  & (3d)$^3$ $^4$F \\\hline\end{tabular}\\$^a$The effective charge $Z^\mathrm{eff}$ is calculated from $\mathrm{IP}_{nl} = \frac{(Z^\mathrm{eff})^2}{2n^2}$ in atomic units.$^b$The quantum defect $\delta$ is calculated from $\mathrm{IP}_{nl} = \frac{1}{2(n-\delta)^2}$.$^c$For cases with more than one electron, the orbital to be ionized(leading to the ground state of the ion) is underlined.% Ooops! RPM forgot to underline!$^d$All energies are relative to the lowest state of the correspondingion.\end{table}Consider first the K atom. The low-lying states, all energiesreferenced with respect to K$^+$, are listed in Table \ref{chap5-table8}.The effective charge $Z_\mathrm{eff}$, is defined by\begin{equation}\mathrm{IP}_{nl} = {(Z_\mathrm{eff})^2 \over 2n^2}\label{chap5-eqno17}\end{equation}is also listed. In this section, the effective charge $Z_\mathrm{eff}$ is obtained from experimental ionization potentials using (\ref{chap5-eqno17}),whereas in the previous  section, the $Z^*$ were based on orbital sizes from theoretical calculations. The current approach is more useful for quantitative considerations.Thus, the $3d$ orbital sees an effective charge of 1.05, the nucleus being essentially shielded by the core orbitals. The $4s$ orbital, however, has a significant penetration of the core, leading to\begin{equation}Z^\mathrm{eff}_{4s} = 2.26 .\end{equation}Since\begin{equation}\mathrm{IP}_{3d} = {1 \over 2} \left( {Z^\mathrm{eff}_{3d} \over 3} \right)^2 ,\end{equation}and\begin{equation}\mathrm{IP}_{4s} = {1 \over 2} \left( {Z^\mathrm{eff}_{4s} \over 4} \right)^2 ,\end{equation}the $4s$ orbital will be deeper, harder to ionize, as long as\begin{equation}Z^\mathrm{eff}_{4s} > {4 \over 3} Z^\mathrm{eff}_{3d}.\label{chap5-eqno18}\end{equation}This is true for K, and the $4s$ orbital is 2.7 eV deeper, harder to ionize, than $3d$.  For Ca$^+$, Sc$^{++}$, etc., the difference between the $4s$ and $3d$, effective charges, remains about one,\begin{equation}Z^\mathrm{eff}_{4s} - Z^\mathrm{eff}_{3d} \approx 1 ,\label{chap5-eqno19}\end{equation}however, the total effective charges increase faster than $Z$, since the $4s$ and $3d$ orbitals become relatively tighter for the highly ionized cases, thereby leading to a greater penetration of the core. Using(\ref{chap5-eqno18})  and (\ref{chap5-eqno19}), the $3d$ orbital will be deeper when\begin{equation}Z^\mathrm{eff}_{3d} > 3 .\end{equation}As a result, Sc$^{++}$, Ti$^{+++}$, etc., all have the valence electron in the $3d$ orbital, whereas K and Ca$^+$ have the valence electron in $4s$.Another illustrative case is to compare Sc, Sc$^+$, and Sc$^{++}$, Table \ref{chap5-table8}.  Again, as in (\ref{chap5-eqno19}), here\begin{equation}Z^\mathrm{eff}_{3d} = 1.84\end{equation}for Sc, 2.85 for Sc$^+$, and 4.05 for Sc$^{++}$.  Thus, $4s$ is much better than $3d$ for Sc, they are nearly degenerate, $4s$ lower, for Sc$^+$, and $3d$ is much deeper for Sc$^{++}$.As a result of this effect, the lowest states of the doubly ionized ions Sc$^{++}$, Ti$^{++}$,..., Zn$^{++}$, are all $d^n$, no valence electrons in $4s$, despite the fact that for the neutral, most ofthese atoms have two electrons in $4s$.\section{LSJ States of Atoms, Hund's Rule}From the previous section, we were content to determine the ground configurationsof the various atoms.  For example, for C, \begin{equation}(1s)^2(2s)^2(2p)^2,\end{equation}and for Ni \begin{equation}(1s)^2(2s)^2(2p)^6(3s)^3(3p)^6(3d)^8(4s)^2.\end{equation}In fact, however, each such configuration may give rise to severalstates having energies differing by several electron volts, eV.  Thesestates are characterized by a total spatial, or orbital, angularmomentum L, a total spin angular momentum S, and a total angularmomentum J.  Using the symbols (note that J is excluded from thissequence) S, P, D, F, G, H, I, K, ..., to denote $L$ = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,5, 6, 7, ..., the atomic states are labelled as\begin{equation}^{2s + 1}L_J.\end{equation}Thus, the state with $L = 1, S = 1$, and $J = 2$, is denoted as${^3P}_2$.  The $p^2$ configuration (e.g., C, Si, or Ge) leads to${^1S}$, ${^1D}$, and ${^3P}$ states, as indicated in Figure\ref{fig5-11a}, with ${^3P}$ lowest.  $p^3$ leads to ${^4S}$, ${^2D}$,and ${^2P}$ states, as in Figure \ref{fig5-11b}, with ${^4S}$ lowest.$p^4$ leads to the same states ${^3P}$, ${^1D}$, ${^1S}$ as $p^2$, but${^3P}_2$ is lowest, rather than ${^3P}_1$. On the other hand, $p^1$and $p^5$ lead only to ${^2P}$, $J = 3/2, 1/2$, with $J = 1/2$ lowerfor $p^1$, and $J = 3/2$ lower for $p^5$.\begin{figure}\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig5-11a}\caption{}\label{fig5-11a}\end{figure}\begin{figure}\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig5-11b}\caption{}\label{fig5-11b}\end{figure}Summarizing, the LS states for $p^n$ configurations are\begin{eqnarray}p^1 , p^5 &:& {^2P}\crp^2 , p^4 &:& {^3P}, {^1D} , {^1S}\crp^3 &:& {^4S}, {^2D}, {^2P}.\end{eqnarray}The allowed symmetries for various $d^n$ configurations are:\begin{eqnarray}d,d^9 &:& {^2D}\crd^2,d^3 &:& {^3F}, {^3P}, {^1G}, {^2D}, {^1S}\crd^3, d^7 &:& {^4F}, {^4P}, {^2H}, {^2G}, {^2F}, {^2D}, {^2D}, {^2P}\crd^4,d^6 &:& {^5D}, {^3H}, {^3G}, {^3F}, {^3F}, {^3D}, {^3P}, {^3P}, {^1I}, {^1G}, {^1G}, {^1F}, {^1D}, {^1D}, {^1S}, {^1S}\crd^5 &:& {^6S} , {^4G}, {^4F}, {^4D}, {^4P}, {^2I}, {^2H}, {^2G}, {^2G}, {^2F}, {^2D}, {^2D}, {^2D}, {^2P}, {^2S}.\end{eqnarray}In all cases, the ground state symmetry is listed first, but the higher states are not necessarily in the order given.A useful rule for remembering which LS state is the ground state of anatom is \emph{Hund's rule}.  Consider the configuration of orthogonalorbitals corresponding to the ground state of an atom.\begin{description}\item[The $S$ rule] Of all the $LS$ eigenstates resulting from thisconfiguration, the lowest state is the one with the largest $S$.\item[The $L$ rule] If there is more than one $L$ corresponding tothis largest $S$, then the lowest state is the one with the largest$L$.  \item[The $J$ rule] Of the various $J$ states arising fromthe values of $S$ and $L$ obtained in the first two rules, the loweststate is the one of minimum $J$, if the configuration is less thanhalf full, and the one of maximum $J$, configuration is more than halffull.\end{description}We will now examine the physical basis for Hund's rules.\subsection{The $S$ Rule}High spin implies symmetric spin functions.  Because of the Pauli principle, this implies antisymmetric spatial functions.  Since antisymmetric spatial functions lead to exchange integrals with negative signs, we see that highest spin is good, as in the firstrule. For example, the triplet state. $S = 1$, of the $xy$ configuration\begin{equation}{\cal A} \left[ xy \alpha \alpha \right] = \left( xy - yx \right) \alpha \alpha\end{equation}leads to\begin{equation}E = h_{xx} + h_{yy} + J_{xy} - K_{xy}\end{equation}while the single state, $S = 0$, for the configuration\begin{equation}{\cal A} \left[ xy \left( \alpha \beta - \beta \alpha \right) \right] = \left( xy + yx \right) \left( \alpha \beta - \beta \alpha \right)\end{equation}leads to an energy of\begin{equation}E = h_{xx} + h_{yy} + J_{xy} + K_{xy} ,\end{equation}$2K_{xy}$ higher than the triplet state.The high spin state is better because the electrons in the high spin wavefunctiontend to stay further apart.  This can be seen by writing\begin{equation}x(1) = f ( r_1 \theta_1 ) \cos \varphi_1\label{chap5-eqno20a}\end{equation}\begin{equation}y(2) = f (r_2 \theta_2 ) \sin \varphi_2\label{chap5-eqno20b}\end{equation}so that the spatial wavefunction for the triplet state is\begin{eqnarray}(xy-yx) &=& f(1) f(2) [ \cos \varphi_1 \sin \varphi_2 - \sin \varphi_2 \cos \varphi_2 ]\cr&=& f(1) f(2) \sin ( \varphi_2 - \varphi_1 )\end{eqnarray}whereas the spatial wavefunction for the singlet state is\begin{equation}(xy + yx ) = f (1) f(2) \sin ( \varphi_e + \varphi_1 ).\end{equation}Thus, for the triplet state, the electrons cannot have $\varphi_2 = \varphi_1$, and their motions are such that $\varphi_2$ and $\varphi_1$ tend to be at 90 degrees, with respect to each other.  On the other hand, there are no special $\varphi$ correlations in the singlet wavefunction leading to a much larger chance of $\varphi_1 \approx \varphi_2$.  Because the electron-electron interaction is repulsive, small $\varphi_2 - \varphi_1$ leads to extra repulsion resulting in a higher energy for the low spin state.\subsection{The $L$ Rule}Now we consider the second rule through use of an example.  Consider thewavefunctions\begin{equation}xx - yy\label{chap5-eqno21a}\end{equation}\begin{equation}xx + yy\label{chap5-eqno21b}\end{equation}having angular momenta of $M = +2$ and $M = 0$ about the $z$ axis,both correspond to a single state.  Using(\ref{chap5-eqno20a})--(\ref{chap5-eqno20b}), (\ref{chap5-eqno21a})--(\ref{chap5-eqno21b}) becomes\begin{equation}xx - yy = f (1) f(2) \cos ( \varphi_1 + \varphi_2 )\end{equation}\begin{equation}xx + yy = f (1) f(2) \cos ( \varphi_1 - \varphi_2 ).\end{equation}Thus, the $M = 0$ wavefunction has the $\varphi$ coordinates of the electrons correlated so that $\varphi_1$ and $\varphi_2$ tend to be equal, while the $M = 2$ wavefunction has no special correlation of the $\varphi$ coordinates.  Since small $\varphi_1 - \varphi_2$ leads to bigger electron repulsion, the $M = 2$ state is lower.  A physical way of thinking about this is that maximum $M$ corresponds to all electrons circulating in the same direction about the axis.  Thus, the $\varphi_1 - \varphi_2$ coordinates state fixed.  Smaller $M$ have the electrons circulating in opposite directions, and hence, $\varphi_1 - \varphi_2$ must pass through zero, leading to extra repulsion.\subsection{The $J$ Rule}In the third rule, the spin orbital coupling interaction for an atom, has the form\begin{equation}\zeta ( r ) {\bf s} \cdot {\bf l} ,\end{equation}where $\zeta (r) > 0$.  Thus, lower energy is obtain when {\bf s} and {\bf l} are in opposite directions and, hence, the best $J$ should be the lowest one, \begin{equation}J = | L - S|,\end{equation}since this has the spin and orbital momenta in opposite directions.For example, for the ${^3P}_2$ state of $p^2$, we obtain\begin{equation}E_{ls} = \langle p_+ p_0 \alpha \alpha | \sum_{i} \zeta ( r_i ) l_i \cdot s_i | {\cal A} p_+ p_0 \alpha \alpha \rangle = {1 \over 2} \lambda\label{chap5-eqno22}\end{equation}where $\lambda$ is the radical integral\begin{equation}\lambda = \langle f ( r ) | \zeta ( r ) | f ( r ) \rangle\end{equation}and $\lambda$ is positive.To evaluate the energy of the ${^3P}_1$ and ${^3P}_0$ terms is a little more complicated, but can be done using\begin{equation}l \cdot s = {1 \over 2} \left( {\hat l}^+ {\hat s}^- + {\hat l}^- {\hat s}^+ \right) + {\hat l}_z {\hat s}_z\label{chap5-eqno23}\end{equation}and the usual angular momentum properties.  An alternative approach is to use the Wigner-Eckart theorem,\begin{eqnarray}E^{LSJ} &=& \langle LSJM_J | \sum_{i} \zeta ( r_i ) l_i \cdot s_i | LSJM_J \rangle\cr&=& \Lambda \langle LSJM_J | L \cdot S | LSJM_J \rangle\cr&=& {1 \over 2} \Lambda \left[ J ( J + 1 ) - S ( S + 1) - L(L+1)\right].\label{chap5-eqno24}\end{eqnarray}Using (\ref{chap5-eqno22}) in (\ref{chap5-eqno24}), we can evaluate$\Lambda$ as equal to  $1/2\lambda$.  Using (\ref{chap5-eqno24}), we find that\begin{eqnarray}E \left( {^3P}_2 \right) &=& {1 \over 2} \lambda\crE \left( {^3P}_1 \right) &=& - \Lambda = - {1 \over 2} \lambda\crE \left( {^3P}_0 \right) &=& - 2 \Lambda = - \lambda .\end{eqnarray}Since $\lambda > 0$, the $J = 0$ state is lowest.Now consider the $p^4$ configuration.  Everything is as with $p^2$ except that (\ref{chap5-eqno22}) is replaced by\begin{eqnarray}E_{ls} &= \langle p_+ p_0 p_- p_+ \alpha \alpha \alpha \beta | \sum_{i} \zeta ( r_i ) l_i \cdot s_i | p_+ p_0 p_- p_+ \alpha \alpha \alpha \beta \rangle\cr&= {1 \over 2} \lambda - {1 \over 2} \lambda - {1 \over 2} \lambda = - {1 \over 2} \lambda .\cr\end{eqnarray}Thus,\begin{equation}\Lambda = -{1 \over 2} \lambda\end{equation}and the relationships in (\ref{chap5-eqno23}) become\begin{eqnarray}E \left( {^3P}_2 \right) &=& - {1 \over 2} \lambda\crE \left( {^3P}_1 \right) &=& {1 \over 2} \lambda\crE \left( {^3P}_0 \right) &=& \lambda.\end{eqnarray}Thus, the high $J$ state is now the ground state.  That is, with a greater than half-filled shell, the $M_J = J$ state, having maximum $M_L$ and maximum $M_S$, tends to make the unpaired spatial orbitals the one with most negative $M_L$.  Thus, leading to favored spin orbit interactions with the unpaired spins.\subsection{Comments}One should be careful to note what Hund's rule does not say.  It does not tell us which configuration is lowest, rather, given the ground configuration, it tells us which $LSJ$ is best.  In addition, Hund's rule does not tell us the sequence, or order, of the state, it only tells us about the ground state.  Given Hartree-Fock, or Slater determinant wavefunctions, Hund's rules are correct and can be derived, but not trivially.  However, for the exact wavefunctions, interactions between configurations could conceivably lead to a ground state in disagreement with Hund's rule, I know of no such cases.  For excited configurations, such interactions are often present and it is often the case that the sequence of excited state, having a given, dominant, configuration, does not satisfy Hund's rule.\section{Appendices}\subsection{Angular Momenta for Many-Electron Atoms}\subsubsection{Introduction}For a many-electron atom, the Hamiltonian is\begin{equation}H = \sum_{i=1}^{N} h(i) + \sum^{N}_{i>j=1} {1 \over r_{ij}}.\end{equation}Because of the $l/r_{ij}$ term, $l_z(i)$, the angular momentumoperator for electron $i$, does not commute with $H$.  However, the$N$ electron operator\begin{equation}{\hat L}_z = \sum^{N}_{i=1} l_z(i)\end{equation}does commute with $H$, and similarly for $L_x$ and $L_y$.  Consequently,\begin{equation}{\hat L}^2 = L^2_x + L^2_y + L^2_z\end{equation}also commutes with $H$, and hence, the exact eigenfunctions of $H$ can be taken as eigenstates of ${\hat L}^2$ and ${\hat L}_z$.  Similarly, we can define\begin{equation}{\hat S}_z = \sum^{N}_{i=1} s_z (i)\end{equation}and ${\hat S}^2$, both of which commute with $H$.  Consequently, all eigenfunctions of $H$ can be taken as eigenstates of ${\hat L}^2$, ${\hat L}_z$, ${\hat S}^2$, and $S_z$,\begin{eqnarray}H \psi_{NLM_LSM_S} &=& E_{NLS} \psi_{NLM_LSM_S}\cr{\hat L}^2 \psi_{NLM_LSM_S} &=& L(L+1) \psi_{NLM_LSM_S}\cr{\hat L}_z \psi_{NLM_LSM_S} &=& M_L \psi_{NLM_LSM_S}\cr{\hat S}^2 \psi_{NLM_LSM_S} &=& S(S+1) \psi_{NLM_LSM_S}\cr{\hat S}_z \psi_{NLM_LSM_S} &=& M_S \psi_{NLM_LSM_S}.\end{eqnarray}In this section, we will examine how to determine the allowed values of $L$ and $S$, for various configurations.\subsubsection{The $(2p)^2$ Configuration}In Section 5.4, we contented ourselves with determining the ground configurations of the various atoms.  For example,\begin{equation}(1s)^2 (2s)^2 (2p)^2\label{chap5app-eqno1}\end{equation}for $C$.  In this section, we will illustrate some ways of determining the possible spatial and spin symmetries for such wavefunctions.Since there are three possibilities, for each of the $p$ orbitals in(\ref{chap5app-eqno1}), and two possibilities for the spin associatedwith each orbital, there are many possible wavefunctions correspondingto (\ref{chap5app-eqno1}).  On the other hand, the total wavefunctionmust satisfy Pauli's principle, restricting the possibilities.  Sincethere is only one choice allowed for $(1s)^2(2s)^2$, and the essentialproblem here is to determine the possible states of a configuration ofthe form $(2p)^2$.{\bf LS Eigenstates, Complex Orbitals}Each electron is in an orbital of the form\begin{equation}\phi_m = f(r) Y_{1m} ( \theta , \varphi )\end{equation}where $m = 0, \pm 1$ is the angular momentum along the $z$ axis.The Slater determinants, which can be formed from two $p$ orbitals, are as follows:\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{crr}\\ $\Psi$ & $M_L$ & $M_S$ \\${\cal A}(p_+ p_0 \alpha \alpha)$ & +1  &  +1\cr ${\cal A}(p_+p_- \alpha \alpha )$ & 0   &  +1\cr${\cal A}(p_0p_- \alpha \alpha )$ & -1  &  +1\cr${\cal A}(p_+p_+ \alpha \beta  )$ & +2  &  0 \cr${\cal A}(p_+p_0 \alpha \beta  )$ & +1  &  0 \cr${\cal A}(p_+p_- \alpha \beta  )$ & 0   &  0 \cr${\cal A}(p_0p_+ \alpha \beta  )$ & +1  &  0 \cr${\cal A}(p_0p_0 \alpha \beta  )$ & 0   &  0 \cr${\cal A}(p_0p_- \alpha \beta  )$ & -1  &  0 \cr${\cal A}(pp_-p_+\alpha \beta  )$ & 0   &  0 \cr${\cal A}(pp_-p_0\alpha \beta  )$ & -1  &  0 \cr${\cal A}(pp_-p_-\alpha \beta  )$ & -2  &  0 \cr${\cal A}(p_+p_0\beta \beta    )$ & +1  &  -1\cr${\cal A}(p_+p_-\beta \beta    )$ & 0   &  -1\cr${\cal A}(p_0p_-\beta \beta    )$ & -1  &  -1\cr\end{tabular}\end{center}Note that with our definition of ${\cal A}$, e.g., ${\cal A} = e - \pi$ for $N = 2$, each wavefunction is normalized to $\sqrt{N!}$. We have also left out redundant states, e.g.,\begin{equation}{\cal A} \left( p_0 p_+ \alpha \alpha \right) - {\cal A} \left( p_+ p_0 \alpha \alpha \right) ,\end{equation}and zero determinants, e.g.,\begin{equation}{\cal A} \left( p_+ p_+ \alpha \alpha \right) = 0.\end{equation}Here, we have denoted $p_{+1}$ by $p_+$, and similarly for $p - 1$.  Note that the above fifteen states are all orthogonal.In terms of the $M_L$ and $M_S$ quantum numbers, these fifteen states are distributed as follows:\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{rrrrr}\\&&\multicolumn{3}{c}{$M_S$} \\ &&+1 & 0 & -1 \\ \cline{3-5}& 2 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\& 1 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\$M_L$ & 0 & 1 & 3 & 1 \\& -1 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\& -2 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\cline{3-5}\end{tabular}\end{center}Consider, first, the states with $M_S = 1$.  Since $M_S$ is maximum, then ${\hat S}^+$ operating on any of these states, leads to zero, and hence, all states with $M_S = 1$ correspond to $S = 1$.  Recall that\begin{equation}{\hat S}^2 = S^2_z + {\hat S}^- {\hat S}^+\end{equation}thus, if\begin{equation}{\hat S}_z \psi_M = M \psi_M\end{equation}and\begin{equation}{\hat S}^+ \psi_M = 0 ,\end{equation}then\begin{equation}{\hat S}^2 \psi_M = M ( M + 1 ) \psi_M .\end{equation}Now consider the maximum $M_L$ with this $M_S$, $M + L = 1$.  Since ${\hat L}^+$ operating on this state must yield zero, we have $L = 1$.  Thus, we find a ${^3P}$ state.  Applying ${\hat L}^-$ and ${\hat S}^-$, various numbers of times to the ${^3P}$ state with $M_S = 1$, and $M_L = 1$, leads to the nine states:\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{rrrrr}\\&&\multicolumn{3}{c}{$M_S$} \\ &&+1 & 0 & -1 \\ \cline{3-5}& 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\& 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\$M_L$ & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\& -1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\& -2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\cline{3-5}\end{tabular}\end{center}Comparing this with the previous table, we seethat there are six states to be accounted for:\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{rrrrr}\\&&\multicolumn{3}{c}{$M_S$} \\ &&+1 & 0 & -1 \\ \cline{3-5}& 2 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\& 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\$M_L$ & 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\& -1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\& -2 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\cline{3-5}\end{tabular}\end{center}The maximum $M_S$ for these states is $M_S =0$, and the maximum $M_L$ is $M_L = 2$.  Thus, there must be a ${^1D}$state.  Applying ${\hat L}^-$ successively to this $M_L = 2$ stateleads to $M_L + 1, 0 -1 , -2$ states, and comparing withthe above we see that there is one remaining state:\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{rrrrr}\\&&\multicolumn{3}{c}{$M_S$} \\ &&+1 & 0 & -1 \\ \cline{3-5}& 2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\& 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\$M_L$ & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\& -1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\& -2 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\cline{3-5}\end{tabular}\end{center}Thus, the remaining states is ${^1S}$.  Insummary, we find $p^2 \rightarrow {^3P}, {^1D}$, and ${^1S}$.  Sincethese states have degeneracies of 9, 5, and 1, respectively, we haveaccounted for all fifteen states in (\ref{chap5app-eqno2}).We will now use the ${\hat L}^-$ and ${\hat S}^-$ operators, to construct the many-electron wavefunctions corresponding to these states.\begin{equation}^3P : \begin{array}{lrr}\\\Psi & M_S & M_L \\{\cal A} \left[ p_+ \alpha p_0 \alpha \right] & 1 & 1 \\{\cal A} \left[ p_+ \alpha p_- \alpha \right] & 1 & 0 \\{\cal A} \left[ p_0 \alpha  p_p \alpha \right]& 1 & -1\\{1 \over \sqrt{2}} {\cal A} \left[ \left( p_+ p_0 - p_0 p_+ \right) \alpha \beta \right] & 0 & 1 \\{1 \over \sqrt{2}} {\cal A} \left[ \left( p_+ p_- p_- p_+ \right) \alpha \beta \right]& 0 & 0 \\{1 \over \sqrt{2}} {\cal A} \left[ \left( p_0 p_-p_- p_0 \right) \alpha \beta \right]& 0 & -1\\{\cal A} \left[ p_- \beta p_0 \beta \right] &-1 & +1\\{\cal A} \left[ p_+ + \alpha p_- \beta \right]&-1 & 0 \\{\cal A} \left[ p_0 \alpha p_- \beta \right]&-1 & -1\\\end{array}\label{chap5app-eqno7}\end{equation}\begin{equation}{^1D} : \begin{array}{lrr}\\\Psi & M_S & M_L \\{\cal A} \left[ p_+ \alpha p_+ \beta \right] & 0 &  2 \\{1 \over \sqrt{2}} {\cal A} \left[ \left( p_+ p_0 + p_0 p_+ \right) \alpha \beta \right] & 0 &  1 \\{1 \over \sqrt{6}} {\cal A} \left[ \left( 2 p_0 p_0 + p_+ p_- + p_- p_+ \right) \alpha \beta \right] & 0 &  0 \\{1 \over \sqrt{2}} {\cal A} \left[ \left( p_0 p_- + p_- p_0 \right) \alpha \beta \right] & 0 &  -1\\{\cal A} \left[ p_- \alpha p_- \beta \right]& 0 &  -2\\\end{array}\end{equation}For ${^1S}$, the state must be orthogonal to the $M_S = 0, M + L = 0$ state of ${^1D}$ and ${^3P}$.  (Note that the ${^1D}$ states and the ${^3P}$ states are automatically orthogonal.)  Consequently\begin{equation}{^1S} : \begin{array}{lrr}\\\Psi & M_S & M_L \\{1 \over \sqrt{3}} {\cal A} \left[ \left( p_+ p_- + p_- p_+ - p_0 p_0 \right) \alpha \beta \right] &0& 0\\\end{array}\end{equation}In deriving these expressions, we made use of the fact that ${\cal A}$ commutes with ${\hat L}^- , {\hat L}_z , {\hat S}^-$, and ${\hat S}_2$.  This follows since the ${\hat L}_i$ and ${\hat S}_i$ treat all electrons equivalently, and hence, commute with all permutations.  For $M_S = 0$ states, we have permuted terms so that the spinfunctions are in the order $\alpha \beta$.{\bf The $J$ States}Including spin orbital coupling, the energy eigenstates must be eigenfunctions of ${\hat J}^2$ and $J_z$, where ${\hat J}_i = {\hat L}_i + {\hat S}_i$.  For the $p^2$ states, we obtain\begin{eqnarray}{^3P} &:& J = 0 , 1 , 2 ,\cr{^1D} &:& J = 2,\cr{^1S} &:& J = 0.\end{eqnarray}We may recombine the nine ${^3P}$ wavefunctions of (\ref{chap5app-eqno7}) into eigenstates of ${\hat H}^2$ and $J_z$, using a procedure similar to that in Chapter 10.  Starting with $J = 2$ and $M_J = 2$, and using the lowering operator, lead to the following\begin{eqnarray}{^3P}_2 : M_J = 2 &:& {\cal A} \left[ p_+ p_0 \alpha \alpha \right]\cr: M_J = 1 &:& {1 \over 2} {\cal A} \left[ \sqrt{2} p_+ p_- \alpha \alpha + \left( p_+ p_0 - p_0 p_+ \right) \alpha \beta \right]\cr: M_J = 0 &:& {1 \over \sqrt{6}} {\cal A} \left[ p_0 p_- \alpha \alpha + \sqrt{2} \left( p_+ p_- + p_- p_+ \right) \alpha \beta + p_+ p_0 \beta \beta \right]\cr: M_J = - 1 &:& {\cal A} \left[ (p_0 p_- - p_-p_0)\alpha\beta+\sqrt{2}p_+p_-\beta\beta\right]\cr: M_J = - 2 &:& {\cal A} \left[ p_0 p_-\beta\beta \right] .\end{eqnarray}To obtain the $J = 1$ states, we consider the $M_J = 1$ solution orthogonal to the above case, and then apply ${\hat J}^-$ to obtain the other two components, leading to the following\begin{eqnarray}{^3P}_1 : M_J = 1 &:& {1 \over 2} {\cal A} \left[ \sqrt{2} p_+p_- \alpha \alpha - \left( p_+ p_0 - p_0 p_+ \right) \alpha \beta \right]\crM_J = 0 &:& {1 \over \sqrt{2}} {\cal A} \left[ p_0 p_- \alpha \alpha - p_+ p_0 \beta \beta \right]\crM_J = - 1 &:& {\cal A} \left[ p_0 p_- - p_- p_0 \alpha \beta - \sqrt{2} p_+ p_- \beta \beta \right] .\end{eqnarray}Constructing a third $M + J = 0$ state orthogonal to the above two, leads to the following\begin{equation}{^3P}_0 : {1 \over \sqrt{6}} {\cal A} \left[ \sqrt{2} p_0 p_- \alpha \alpha - \left( p_+ p_- - p_- p_+ \right) \alpha \beta + \sqrt{2} p_+ p_0 \beta \beta \right] .\end{equation}More generally, we may write these $J$ states as $|LSJM_J \rangle$, and the original $LS$ states as $|LSM_LM_S \rangle$.  Then\begin{equation}|LSJM_J \rangle = \sum_{M_L,M_S} C^{LS}_{JM_J,M_L,M_S} | LSM_LM_S \rangle\end{equation}where the $C^{LS}_{JM_J,M_L,M_S}$ are the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients, also called the vector addition, or Wigner coefficients.  Tabulations are found in many references.$^1${\bf LS Eigenstates, Real Orbitals}The above analysis of $L, S , J$ eigenstates, was greatly facilitated because the orbitals used are eigenstates of ${\hat l}_z$\begin{equation}{\hat l}_z Y_{lm} = mY_{lm} .\label{chap5app-eqno8}\end{equation}For molecular problems, the spherical symmetry of the atom is lost and the complex functions of (\ref{chap5app-eqno8}) are generally notappropriate.  For  example, in ${\bf D}_{2h}$ symmetry, the $p$ state is split into $p_x , p_y$ and $p_z$ states, each with different symmetry, and hence, generally with different energy.  Thus, for molecular considerations, it is generally useful to rewrite the $LS$ eigenstates in terms of real wavefunctions\begin{equation}f(r) Z_{lm} ( \theta , \varphi ) .\end{equation}Starting with the complex functions, as above, this can be done by expanding each wavefunction, using\begin{eqnarray}\phi_{p_{+1}} &=& - {1 \over \sqrt{2}} \left( \phi_{px} + i \phi_{py} \right)\cr\phi_{p_{-1}} &=& {1 \over \sqrt{2}} \left( \phi_{px} - i \phi_{py} \right)\cr\phi_{p_0} &=& \phi_{pz} ,\end{eqnarray}and recombining the resulting two-electron wavefunctions.  A faster procedure is to note that the spatial part of the ${^3P}$ state is permutationally antisymmetric\begin{equation}\begin{array}{c}\fbox{1}\\\fbox{2}\end{array}\end{equation}and hence, only\begin{eqnarray}\Phi^P_x &=& {1 \over \sqrt{2}} \left( \phi_y \phi_z - \phi_z \phi_y \right)\cr\Phi^P_y &=& {1 \over \sqrt{2}} \left( \phi_z \phi_z - \phi_x \phi_z \right)\cr\Phi^P_z &=& {1 \over \sqrt{2}} \left( \phi_x \phi_y - \phi_y \phi_x \right) .\label{chap5app-eqno9}\end{eqnarray}correspond to $L = 1$.  Combining this with the three $S = 1$ spin functions, leads to the nine ${^3P}$ states in(\ref{chap5app-eqno12}).  The ${^1D}$  and ${^1S}$ states have permutationally symmetric \begin{equation}\begin{array}{c}\fbox{1}\fbox{2}\end{array}\end{equation}spatial functions.  Of these, the combination\begin{eqnarray}\Phi^S &=& {1 \over \sqrt{3}} \left[ \phi_x (1) \phi_x (2) + \phi_y (1) \phi_y (2) + \phi_z (1) \phi_z (2) \right]\cr&=& {1 \over \sqrt{3}} \left[ \phi_x \phi_x + \phi_y \phi_y + \phi_z \phi_z \right]\label{chap5app-eqno10}\end{eqnarray}is invariant under any rotation leading to the $L = 0$, or $S$, state.  Thus, the other five symmetric functions\begin{eqnarray}\Phi^D_{z^2} &=& {1 \over \sqrt{6}} \left[ 2 \phi_z \phi_z - \phi_x \phi_x - \phi_y \phi_y \right]\cr\Phi^D_{x^2-y^2} &=& {1 \over \sqrt{2}} \left[ \phi_x \phi_x - \phi_y \phi_y \right]\cr\Phi^D_{xy} &=& {1 \over \sqrt{2}} \left[ \phi_x \phi_y + \phi_y \phi_x \right]\cr\Phi^D_{xz} &=& {1 \over \sqrt{2}} \left[ \phi_x \phi_z + \phi_z \phi_x \right]\cr\Phi^D_{yz} &=& {1 \over \sqrt{2}} \left[ \phi_y \phi_z + \phi_z \phi_y \right]%\label{chap5app-eqno11}\end{eqnarray}describe the $L = 2$, or $D$ state.  Summarizing, in terms of real functions, the fifteen states of $(p^2)$ are as follows\begin{equation}\begin{array}{rrl}\\{^3P} & 1 & {\cal A} \left( p_x p_y \alpha \alpha \right)\cr&& {\cal A} \left( p_x p_z \alpha \alpha \right)\cr&& {\cal A} \left( p_y p_z \alpha \alpha \right)\cr&0 & {1 \over \sqrt{2}} {\cal A} \left[ p_x p_y \left( \alpha \beta + \beta \alpha \right) \right] = {1 \over \sqrt{2}} {\cal A} \left[ \left( p_x p_y - p_y p_x \right) \alpha \beta \right]\cr &&{1 \over \sqrt{2}} {\cal A} \left[ p_x p_z \left( \alpha \beta + \beta \alpha \right) \right] = {1 \over \sqrt{2}} {\cal A} \left[ \left( p_x p_z - p_z p_x \right) \alpha \beta \right]\cr &&{1 \over \sqrt{2}} {\cal A} \left[ p_y p_z \left( \alpha \beta + \beta \alpha \right) \right] = {1 \over \sqrt{2}} {\cal A} \left[ \left( p_y p_z - p_z p_y \right) \alpha \beta \right]\cr& -1 & {\cal A} \left( p_x p_y \beta \beta \right)\cr&& {\cal A} \left( p_x p_z \beta \beta \right)\cr&& {\cal A} \left( p_y p_z \beta \beta \right)\cr{^1D} & & {1 \over \sqrt{2}} {\cal A} \left[ \left( p_x p_x -  p_y p_y \right) \alpha \beta \right]\cr&& {1 \over \sqrt{2}} {\cal A} \left[ \left( p_x p_y +  p_y p_x \right) \alpha \beta \right]\cr&& {1 \over \sqrt{2}} {\cal A} \left[ \left( p_x p_z +  p_z p_x \right) \alpha \beta \right]\cr&& {1 \over \sqrt{2}} {\cal A} \left[ \left( p_y p_z +  p_z p_y \right) \alpha \beta \right]\cr&& {1 \over \sqrt{6}} {\cal A} \left[ \left( 2 p_z p_z -  p_x p_x - p_y p_y \right) \alpha \beta \right]\cr{^1S} && {1 \over \sqrt{3}} {\cal A} \left[ \left( p_x p_x +  p_y p_y + p_z p_z \right) \alpha \beta \right]\end{array}\end{equation}Note that in terms of real orbitals, only the $M_S = \pm 1$ components of ${^3P}$ can be written as single Slater determinants, whereas for the complex form, the $M_L = \pm 2$ components of ${^1D}$ could also be written as single Slater determinants.{\bf Energies for $(2p)^2$ Wavefunctions}In the following appendix, we evaluate the energies of the $p^2$ states.  The result is\begin{eqnarray}E \left( {^3P} \right) &=& h_{xx} + h_{yy} + J_{xy} - K_{xy}\cr&=& {2 \over 3} h^0 + {1 \over 6} J^0 - {1 \over 6} K^0\crE \left( {^1D} \right) &=& h_{xx} + h_{yy} + J_{xy} + K_{xy}\cr&=& h_{xx} + h_{yy} + J_{xx} - K_{xy}\cr&=& {2 \over 3} h^0 + {1 \over 10} J^0 + {1 \over 30} K^0\crE \left( {^1S} \right) &=& h_{xx} + h_{yy} + J_{xx} + 2K_{xy}\cr&=& {2 \over 3} h^0 + {1 \over 3} K^0\label{chap5app-eqno15}\end{eqnarray}where\begin{eqnarray}h^0 &=& \sum^{3}_{i=1} h_{ii}\crJ^0 &=& \sum^{3}_{i,j=1} J_{ij}\crK^0 &=& \sum^{3}_{i,j=1} K_{ij}\label{chap5app-eqno16}\end{eqnarray}The expressions in (\ref{chap5app-eqno15}) are obtained directly fromthe wavefunctions.  These qualities have been rewritten in terms ofthe spherical invariants, by which we mean that the quantities areeach invariant under any rotation about the origin.  From(\ref{chap5app-eqno15}) we see that the general energy expression is\begin{equation}E = fh^0 + aJ^0 + b K^0\end{equation}and hence, the variational Hamiltonian is\begin{equation}H = fh + 2a \sum_{j} J_j + 2b \sum_{j} K_j .\end{equation}This Hamiltonian is invariant under all rotations, and hence, its eigenstates are spherical harmonics\begin{equation}H \phi_i = \epsilon_i \phi_i\end{equation}\begin{equation}\phi_i = f_i (r) Z_{lm} \left( \theta , \varphi \right) .\end{equation}Using (\ref{chap5app-eqno15}), or (\ref{chap5app-eqno16}), we see that\begin{equation}{E({^1S}) - E({^1D}) \over E( {^1D} ) - E ( {^3P})} = {3K_{xy} \over 2K_{xy}} = {3 \over 2}\end{equation}with $E( {^1S} ) > E( {^1D} ) > E( {^3P} )$.  Thus, the energy diagram is as in Figure \ref{fig5-a-1}.\begin{figure}\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig5-12}\caption{}\label{fig5-a-1}\end{figure}\noindentFigure \ref{fig5-a-1} is the energy diagram for $(p)^2$.\subsubsection{Other $(2p)^n$ Configurations}{\bf More Than Half-filled Configurations}Consider a $(p)^4$ configuration, as the O atom.  There are six spin orbitals to be occupied, $p_+ \alpha , p_0 \alpha , p_- \alpha , p_+ \beta , p_0 \beta$, and $p_- \beta$, of which we will occupy four.  For example,\begin{equation}{\cal A} \left( p_+ p_0 p_- p_+ \alpha \alpha \alpha \beta \right).\end{equation}All together, we find 15 such wavefunctions, each of which corresponds exactly to one of the 15 $p^2$ functions in(\ref{chap5app-eqno2}).   This correspondence is as follows\begin{equation}{\cal A} \left( p_+ p_0 p_- p_+ \alpha \alpha \alpha \beta \right) \leftrightarrow {\cal A} \left( p_0 p_- \beta \beta \right)\end{equation}\begin{equation}{\cal A} \left( p_+ p_0 p_0 p_- \alpha \alpha \beta \beta \right) \leftrightarrow {\cal A} \left( p_- p_+ \alpha \beta \right),\end{equation}etc.  This is, considering the $p^4$ configuration, we identify whichtwo spin orbitals are not occupied (that is, the \emph{holes}) and itis the two-electron configuration with only these holes occupied thatcorresponds to the $p^4$ configuration.  Since the $M_L$ for the $p^2$configuration has the same symmetries as a $p^2$ configuration, thatis\begin{equation}p^4 \rightarrow {^3P} , {^1D}, {^1S} .\end{equation}{\bf Summary}The allowed symmetries for various $p^n$ configurations are listed as follows\begin{eqnarray}p^1 , p^5 &:& {^2P}\crp^2 , p^4 &:& {^3P}, {^1D}, {^1S}\crp^3 &:& {^4S} , {^2D} , {^2P}\end{eqnarray}\subsubsection{The $(d)^n$ Configurations}The general procedure of obtaining the allowed $L$ and $S$ values, for a configuration is \begin{enumerate}\item Find the number of orthogonal determinants allowed for each $M_S \geq 0$ and $M_L \geq 0$.  \item Start with the largest allowed $M_S$ and with the largest $M_L$ for this $M_S$.  Since ${\hat L}^+$ and ${\hat S}^+$ on these states must both lead to zero, these states have $L = M_L$ and $S = M_S$.  \item Considering the increases in the numbers of state for smaller $M_L$, we find the other $L$ states allowed for $S = M_S$.  \item Consider the next largest $M_S$, starting with the larges allowed $M_L$. \item Continue this procedure until all states are considered.  \end{enumerate}We will illustrate the process once more, for the $(d^3)$ configuration.{\bf The $(d^3)$ Configurations}We find (using an obvious shorthand notation)\begin{equation}\begin{array}{rrl}\\M_S & M_L & \mathrm{State} \\3/2 & 3 & \left( 2^{\alpha} 1^{\alpha} 0^{\alpha} \right)\cr& 2 & \left( 2^{\alpha} 1^{\alpha} {\bar{1}}^{\alpha} \right)\cr& 1 & \left( 2^{\alpha} 0^{\alpha} {\bar{1}}^{\alpha} , 2^{\alpha} 1^{\alpha} {\bar{1}}^{\alpha} \right)\cr& 0 & \left( 1^{\alpha} 0^{\alpha} {\bar{1}}^{\alpha} \right) , \left( 2^{\alpha} 0^{\alpha} {\bar{1}}^{\alpha} \right)\cr1/2 & 5 & \left( 2^{\alpha} 1^{\alpha} 2^{\beta} \right),\cr& 4 & \left( 2^{\alpha} 0^{\alpha} 2^{\beta} \right) , \left( 2^{\alpha} 1^{\alpha} 1^{\beta} \right),\cr& 3 & \left( 2^{\alpha} {\bar 1}^{\alpha} 2^{\beta} \right) , \left( 1^{\alpha} 0^{\alpha} 2^{\beta} \right), \left( 2^{\alpha} 0^{\alpha} 1^{\beta} \right), \left( 2^{\alpha} 1^{\alpha} 0^{\beta} \right) ,\cr& 2 & \left( 2^{\alpha} {\bar 2}^{\alpha} 2^{\beta} \right) , \left( 1^{\alpha} {\bar 1}^{\alpha} 2^{\beta} \right) , \left( 2^{\alpha} {\bar 1}^{\alpha} 1^{\beta} \right) , \left( 1^{\alpha} 0^{\alpha} 1^{\beta} \right) , \left( 2^{\alpha} 1^{\alpha} {\bar 1}^{\beta} \right)\cr& 1 & \left( 1^{\alpha} {\bar 2}^{\alpha} 2^{\beta} \right) , \left( 0^{\alpha} {\bar 1}^{\alpha} 2^{\beta} \right) , \left( 2^{\alpha} {\bar 2}^{\alpha} 1^{\beta} \right) , \left( 1^{\alpha} {\bar 1}^{\alpha} 1^{\beta} \right) ,\cr&& \left( 2^{\alpha} {\bar 1}^{\alpha} 0^{\beta} \right) , \left( 1^{\alpha} 0^{\alpha} 0^{\beta} \right) , \left( 2^{\alpha} 0^{\alpha} {\bar 1}^{\beta} \right) , \left( 2^{\alpha} 1^{\alpha} {\bar 2}^{\beta} \right)\cr& 0 & \left( 0^{\alpha} {\bar 2}^{\alpha} 2^{\beta} \right) , \left( 1^{\alpha} {\bar 2}^{\alpha} 1^{\beta} \right) , \left( 0^{\alpha} {\bar 1}^{\alpha} 1^{\beta} \right) , \left( 2^{\alpha} {\bar 2}^{\alpha} 0^{\beta} \right) ,\cr&& \left( 1^{\alpha} {\bar 1}^{\alpha} 0^{\beta} \right) , \left( 2^{\alpha} {\bar 1}^{\alpha} {\bar 1}^{\beta} \right) , \left( 1^{\alpha} 0^{\alpha} {\bar 1}^{\beta} \right) , \left( 2^{\alpha} 0^{\alpha} {\bar 2}^{\beta} \right).\cr\end{array}\end{equation}Therefore, we obtain the numbers in Figure \ref{fig5-a-2}, for $d^3$.\begin{figure}\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig5-13}\caption{}\label{fig5-a-2}\end{figure}\begin{enumerate}\item Consider $M_S = 3/2$.  From $M_L = 3$ we know that we have one ${^4F}$, since there are one fewer states after applying ${\hat L}^+$.  Thus, \begin{enumerate}\item $M_L = 3$ must have one ${^4F}$;  \item $M_L = 2$ no new states, since we obtain the same number after  applying ${\hat L}^+$;  \item $M_L = 1$ must have one ${^4P}$;\item $M_L = 0$ no new states.\end{enumerate}\item Now consider $M_S = 1/2$: \begin{enumerate}\item $M_L = 5$ we have one ${^2H}$;  \item $M_L = 4$ we have one ${^2G}$;  \item $M_L = 3$ we have $F$ states, since there are two fewer after applying ${\hat L}^+$. But we already have one ${^4F}$, therefore we must also have one ${^2F}$. \item $M_L = 2$, two $D$ states and both are ${^2D}$ since there is no ${^4D}$.  \item $M_L = 1$ two $p$ states, applying ${\hat L}^+$, but one is ${^4P}$, therefore one is ${^2P}$.  \item $M_L = 0$, no $s$ states.\end{enumerate}\end{enumerate}Therefore, the $d^3$ configuration is ${^4F} , {^4P} , {^2H}, {^2G} ,{^2F}, {^2D}, {^2D}$, and ${^2P}$.  The check for this would be, for$\alpha \alpha \alpha$ we have $5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3/6 = 10$ differentdeterminants, which checks.  And for $\alpha \alpha \beta$, we have $(5\cdot 4/2)5 = 50$ different determinants, which also checks.\subsubsection{Inequivalent Configurations}Earlier we considered the $(2p)^2$ configuration and found that only${^3P} , {^1D}$, and ${^1S}$ states are allowed by the Pauliprinciple.  Consider now the case $(2p)^1(3p)^1$ so that the twoelectrons are in inequivalent orbitals.  This $\phi_x \phi_x$ statecan be replaced by a permutatonally symmetric term\begin{equation}\phi_{2x} \phi_{3x}  + \phi_{3s} \phi_{2x}\label{chap5app-eqno18}\end{equation}or an antisymmetric term\begin{equation}\phi_{2x} \phi_{3x} - \phi_{3x} \phi_{2x} .\label{chap5app-eqno19}\end{equation}Thus, we get two wavefunctions with $S$ symmetry $(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)$: one using (\ref{chap5app-eqno18}) leads to a singlet state${^1S}$, and the  other using (\ref{chap5app-eqno19}) leads to ${^3S}$.  Similarly, the$xy - yx$ term becomes\begin{equation}\left( \phi_{2x} \phi_{3y} \pm \phi_{3y} \phi_{2x} \right) - \left( \phi_{2y} \phi_{3x} \pm \phi_{3x} \phi_{2y} \right)\end{equation}which leads to ${^3P}$ and ${^1P}$.  Thus, with inequivalent orbitals, we obtain \begin{equation}(2p)(3p) \rightarrow {^3D} , {^1D}, {^3P} , {^1P} , {^3S}, {^1S}.\end{equation}No states are excluded by the Pauli principle.\subsection{Energies for $(2p)^2$ Wavefunctions}We will not evaluate the energies for the wavefunctions.  All energies will involve the same one-electron contributions, $2 \langle p | h | p \rangle$, so we will just consider the two-electron terms.\subsubsection{Energies Using Real Wavefunctions}Using the real wavefunctions of equations (\ref{chap5app-eqno12})through (\ref{chap5app-eqno14}), or (\ref{chap5app-eqno10})  and (\ref{chap5app-eqno11}), leads to the following energies:\begin{equation}\begin{array}{rl}\\\mathrm{State} & \mathrm{Energy}\\{^3P} & J_{xy} - K_{xy} = J_{xz} - K_{xz} = J_{yz} - K_{yz} \\{^1D} & J_{xy} + K_{xy} - J_{xz} + K_{xz} = J_{yz} - K_{yz}\\& = {1 \over 2} \left[ J_{xx} + J_{yy} - 2 K_{xy} \right]\cr& = {1 \over 6} \left[ 4 J_{zz} + J_{xx} + J_{yy} - 4 K_{xz} - 4 K_{yz} + 2 K_{xy} \right]\cr{^1S} & {1 \over 3} \left[ J_{zz} + J_{xx} + J_{yy} + 2 K_{xy} + 2K_{xz} + 2 K_{yz} \right].\\\end{array}\label{chap5app-eqno22}\end{equation}Using symmetry, there are only three different quantities here, $J_{xx} , J_{xy}$, and $K_{xy}$ so that the above energies reduce to\begin{eqnarray}{^3D} &:&  E = J_{xy} - K_{xy}\cr{^1D} &:&  E = J_{xy} + K_{xy} = J_{xx} - K_{xy}\cr{^1S} &:&  E - J_{xx} + 2 K_{xy} .\label{chap5app-eqno23}\end{eqnarray}Since both expressions for $E({^1D})$ must be the same, we find that the Coulomb and exchange integrals must be related by\begin{equation}J_{xx} = J_{xy} + 2 K_{xy}\end{equation}Consequently,\begin{eqnarray}{^3P} &:& E = J_{xy} - K_{xy}\cr{^1D} &:& E = J_{xy} + K_{xy}\cr{^1S} &:& E = J_{xy} + 4 K_{xy}\label{chap5app-eqno24}\end{eqnarray}leading to\begin{equation}{E({^1S}) - E({^1D}) \over E({^1D}) - E({^3P})} = {3K_{xy} \over 2K_{xy}} = {3 \over 2}.\label{chap5app-eqno25}\end{equation}Thus, since $K_{xy} > 0$, we see that the states must be in the order given in Figure \ref{fig5-a-3}, with the ratio of 3 to 2 in the energy separations.  \begin{figure}\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig5-14}\caption{The energy diagram for $(2p)^2$.}\label{fig5-a-3}\end{figure}\subsubsection{Spherically Averaged Energies}The problem with the energy expressions of (\ref{chap5app-eqno20})through (\ref{chap5app-eqno23}), or (\ref{chap5app-eqno24}),  is that they distinguish specific directions over others. For example, using\begin{equation}E = \langle x | h | x \rangle + \langle y | h | y \rangle + J_{xy} + K_{xy}\end{equation}leads to variational operators\begin{equation}H_x = h + J_y + K_y\end{equation}and\begin{equation}H_y = h + J_x + K_x.\end{equation}Since the operators do not have spherical symmetry, the solutions are not spherical harmonics\begin{equation}\phi_u = f ( r ) Y_{lm} \left( \theta , \varphi \right) .\end{equation}In order to remedy this, we will average the energy expressions for different equivalent states.  Thus, (\ref{chap5app-eqno20}),(\ref{chap5app-eqno21}), and (\ref{chap5app-eqno22}) lead to \begin{eqnarray}E ( {^3P} ) &=& {1 \over 3} \sum_{i>j} \left( J_{ij} - K_{ij}\right)\\E ( {^1D} ) &=& {1 \over 3} \sum_{i>j} \left( J_{ij} + K_{ij}\right) = {1 \over 3} \sum_{i} J_{ii} - {1 \over 3} \sum_{i>j} K_{ih}\\E ( {^1S} ) &=& {1 \over 3} \sum_{i>j} J_{ii} + {2 \over 3} \sum_{i>j} K_{ij} .\label{chap5app-eqno26}\end{eqnarray}Since only equal energies were averaged together, nothing has been changed but the appearance of the energy expression.  Going one step further, we add\begin{equation}{1 \over 6} \sum_{i} \left( J_{ii} - K_{ii} \right) = 0 ,\label{chap5app-eqno29}\end{equation}to (\ref{chap5app-eqno26}), leading to\begin{equation}E \left( {^3P} \right) = {1 \over 6} \left( J^0 - K^0 \right)\label{chap5app-eqno30}\end{equation}where\begin{equation}J^0 = \sum_{i,j} J_{ij}\label{chap5app-eqno31a}\end{equation}and\begin{equation}K^0 = \sum_{i,j} K_{ij}\label{chap5app-eqno31b}\end{equation}are spherically invariant.  Similarly, using (\ref{chap5app-eqno29}),(\ref{chap5app-eqno28}) becomes \begin{equation}E \left( {^1S} \right) = {1 \over 3} K^0 .\label{chap5app-eqno32}\end{equation}This leads to\begin{eqnarray}E ( {^1D} ) &=& {1 \over 5} \sum_{i>j} \left( J_{ij} + K_{ij}\right)     + {2 \over 15} \sum_{i>j} \left( J_{ij} - K_{ij}\right) \cr &=& {1 \over 10} J^0 + {1 \over 30} K^0\label{chap5app-eqno33}\end{eqnarray}Thus, we find that\begin{equation}E ( {^1S} ) - E ( {^1D} ) = {1 \over 10} \left( 3K^0 - J^0 \right)\end{equation}\begin{equation}E ( {^1D} ) - E ( {^3P} ) = {1 \over 15} \left( 3 K^0 - J^0 \right)\end{equation}leading again to (\ref{chap5app-eqno25}).  Comparing to(\ref{chap5app-eqno24}), we see that\begin{equation}{1 \over 15} \left( 3K^0 - J^0 \right) = 2 K_{xy} > 0 .\end{equation}From (\ref{chap5app-eqno30}) through (\ref{chap5app-eqno33}), we seethat for each state, the energy can be written as\begin{equation}E = f \sum_{i} h_{ii} + a \sum_{i,j} J_{ij} + b \sum_{i,j} K_{ij} ,\end{equation}where each sum is over the three $p$ functions, $f = 2/3$ for the $p^2$ configuration.  Thus, the variational Hamiltonian is\begin{equation}H = fh  + 2 a \sum_{j} J_j + 2 b \sum_{j} K_j .\end{equation}This operator is rotationally invariant, and hence, the eigenstates\begin{equation}H \phi_i = \epsilon_i \phi_i\end{equation}are spherical harmonics\begin{equation}\phi_i = f_i ( r ) Z_{lm} ( \theta , \varphi ) .\end{equation}\subsubsection{Energies Using Complex Orbitals}Using complex orbitals $p_+ , p_0$, and $p_-$, the energies for the $p^2$ configurations are\begin{equation}\begin{array}{rl}\mathrm{State} & \mathrm{Energy}\\{^3P} & J_{+0} - K_{+0} = J_{+-} - K_{+-} = J_{0-} - K_{0-}\cr{^1D} & J_{++} = J_{+0} + K_{+0}\cr  &= {1 \over 6} \left( 1 J_{00} + 2J_{+-} + 2K_{+-} - 4K_{+0} - 4K_{0+} \right)\cr&= J_{-0} + K_{-0} = J_{--}\cr{^1S} & {1 \over 3} \left( 2 J_{+-} + J_{00} + 2K_{+-} + 2K_{+0} + 2K_{-0} \right)\cr\end{array}\end{equation}where we have used $\phi^*_0 = \phi_0$, and\begin{eqnarray}\langle 0 0 | {1 \over r_{12}} | + - \rangle &= \int d \tau_1 \phi_0 (1) \underbrace{\phi_+(1)}_{-\phi_-(1)*} \int d \tau_2 {1 \over r_{12}} \phi_b (2) \phi_- (2)\cr&= - \langle - 0 | {1 \over r_{12}} | 0 - \rangle = - K_{0-}\cr\end{eqnarray}Averaging over the various components, of a state, and using $J_{++} = J_{--} = J_{+-}$, we obtain\begin{equation}\begin{array}{rl}\mathrm{State} & \mathrm{Energy}\\{^3P} & {1 \over 6} J^0 - {1 \over 6} K^0\cr{^1D} & {1 \over 10} J^0 - {1 \over 30} K^0\cr{^1S} & {1 \over 3} K^0 \\\end{array}\end{equation}where\begin{equation}J^0 = \sum^{+1}_{m,m^{\prime}=-1} J_{mm^{\prime}}\end{equation}and\begin{equation}K^0 = \sum^{+1}_{m,m^{\prime}=-1} J_{mm^{\prime}}\end{equation}are the spherical invariants and are equivalent to the forms used in (\ref{chap5app-eqno31}).\subsection{The Virial Theorem}To summarize, in a system of particles interacting through a Coulomb potential, the total kinetic energy $T$, total potential energy $V$, and total energy $E$, are related as\begin{equation}E = - T = {1 \over 2} V.\end{equation}This relationship is also true for approximate wavefunctions if the scale of the approximate wavefunction is optimized.\subsubsection{Coulomb Potentials}In this chapter, we found that any approximate wavefunction yields an energy greater than, or equal to, the exact energy.  Hence, varying various parameters in the wavefunction to minimize the energy, should lead to better wavefunctions for the ground state.  As a corollary, we know that the energy of the exact wavefunction must already be a minimum, with respect to variation of any parameters in the wavefunction.  This knowledge can be used to obtain a relationship between the average kinetic and potential energies of a wavefunction.Starting with some wavefunction $\phi_1(r)$, say\begin{equation}\phi_1 (r) = e^{-2r} \cos (3r) ,\end{equation}we will consider the scaled wavefunction\begin{equation}\phi_{\alpha} (r) = e^{-2 \alpha r} \cos \left( 3 \alpha r \right) ,\end{equation}obtained from $\phi_1(r)$ by replacing $r$ with $\alpha r$. This amounts to squeezing a wavefunction by a factor of $\alpha$, as indicated in Figure \ref{fig5-x-4}.  \begin{figure}\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{fig5-c-1}\caption{Illustration for the virial theorem.}\label{fig5-x-4}\end{figure}The energy of the new wavefunction is given by\begin{equation}E_{\alpha} = T_{\alpha} + V_{\alpha}\end{equation}where\begin{equation}T_{\alpha} = {\langle \phi_{\alpha} | - {1 \over 2} \nabla^2 | \phi_{\alpha} \rangle \over \langle \phi_{\alpha} | \phi_{\alpha} \rangle}\end{equation}and\begin{equation}V_{\alpha} = {\langle \phi_{\alpha} | - {Z \over r} | \phi_{\alpha} \rangle \over \langle \phi_{\alpha} | \phi_{\alpha} \rangle} .\end{equation}But\begin{equation}\phi_{\alpha} (r) = \phi_1 ( \alpha r )\end{equation}and $\phi_1(r)$ are normalized,\begin{equation}\langle \phi_1 | \phi_1 \rangle = \int d^3 r \phi^*_1 (4) \phi_1 (r) = 1 ,\end{equation}so that\begin{eqnarray}\langle \phi_{\alpha} | \phi_{\alpha} \rangle &=& \int d^3 r \phi^*_{\alpha} (r) \phi_{\alpha} (r) = \int d^3 r \phi^*_i ( \alpha r ) \phi_1 ( \alpha r )\cr&=& {1 \over \alpha^3} \int d^3 ( \alpha r ) \phi^*_1 ( \alpha r ) \phi_1 ( \alpha r ) = {1 \over \alpha^3} \int d^3 r^{\prime} \phi^*_1 (r^{\prime} ) \phi_1 (r^{\prime} )\cr&=& {1 \over \alpha^3}\end{eqnarray}Similarly\begin{eqnarray}\langle \phi_{\alpha} | - {Z \over r} | \phi_{\alpha} \rangle &=& \alpha \langle \phi_{\alpha} (r) | - {Z \over \alpha r} | \phi_{\alpha} (r) \rangle\cr&=& {\alpha \over \alpha^3} \langle \phi_1 ( \alpha r ) | - {Z \over \alpha r} | \phi_1 ( \alpha r ) \rangle \cr&=& {\alpha \over \alpha^3} V_1 ,\end{eqnarray}where\begin{equation}V_1 = \langle \phi_1 (r) | - {Z \over r} | \phi_1 (r) \rangle = \langle \phi_1 ( \alpha r )  | - {Z \over \alpha r} | \phi_1 ( \alpha r ) \rangle .\label{chap5app-eqno34}\end{equation}In (\ref{chap5app-eqno34}) the two forms just differ by a change of variable $r^{\prime} - \alpha r$.  This does not change the boundary conditions, since the wavefunction is zero at $t = \infty$, and hence, at $r^{\prime} = \infty$, and (\ref{chap5app-eqno34}) follows.  Thus,\begin{equation}V_{\alpha} = \alpha V_1 .\label{chap5app-eqno35}\end{equation}Similarly\begin{equation}T_{\alpha} = \alpha^2 T_1 ,\label{chap5app-eqno36}\end{equation}so that the energy has the form\begin{equation}E_{\alpha} = \alpha^2 T_1 + \alpha V_1 .\end{equation}Requiring $E_{\alpha}$ to be a minimum with respect to the $\alpha$, leads to\begin{equation}0 = 2 \alpha T_1 + V_1\end{equation}or\begin{equation}\alpha = - {V_1 \over 2T_1}.\label{chap5app-eqno37}\end{equation}Thus, from (\ref{chap5app-eqno35}) and (\ref{chap5app-eqno36}), we obtain\begin{eqnarray}V^\mathrm{opt} &=& - {(V_1)^2 \over 2T_1}\crT^\mathrm{opt} &=& + {(V_1)^2 \over 4T_1}\end{eqnarray}and hence,\begin{equation}2T^\mathrm{opt} + V^\mathrm{opt} = 0 .\label{chap5app-eqno38}\end{equation}This is called the \emph{virial theorem}, and leads to\begin{equation}E^\mathrm{opt} = - T^\mathrm{opt} = + {1 \over 2} V^\mathrm{opt} .\end{equation}Since the exact eigenfunction must already be optimum with respect to scaling, (\ref{chap5app-eqno38}) must apply to the exact wavefunction.\subsubsection{Other Potentials}If, instead of the Coulomb potential,\begin{equation}{\hat V} = - {Z \over r} ,\end{equation}we consider some other homogeneous potential,\begin{equation}V = \beta r^n ,\end{equation}then the above scaling considerations, lead to\begin{equation}E_{\alpha} = \alpha^2 T_1 + \alpha^{-n} V_1\end{equation}and hence, to\begin{equation}2 \alpha T_1 - n \alpha^{-n-1} V_1  0\end{equation}in place of (\ref{chap5app-eqno37}).  This results in the general formof the virial theorem\begin{equation}2 T^\mathrm{opt} = n V^\mathrm{opt}\end{equation}in place of (\ref{chap5app-eqno38}).  For example, a harmonicoscillator has $n = 2$, and hence,\begin{equation} T^\mathrm{opt} = V^\mathrm{opt} .\end{equation}
